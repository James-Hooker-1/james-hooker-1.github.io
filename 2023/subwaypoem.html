<p>3/20/23</p><br>
<p>In my breath I hold the scene-</p>
<p>A guitar player’s lazy contributions, the rumbling from the deep</p>
<p>The smell of rodents, and eye contact that means nothing.</p>
<p>There are so many of us standing in wait</p>
<p>Going the same place, coming from nowhere.</p>
<p>And I wonder- </p>
<p>Who else is totally floored by this moment?</p>
<p>How many eyes must I glance over before I see another lost in
dream-like translucency?</p>
<p>It’s a mirror I seek, and if it’s a mirror, let myself become empty,
blank, clear</p>
<p>Still water.</p>
<p>Let myself become the reflection.</p>
<p>So, if I ever happen to let my guard down</p>
<p>Or fall into an un-ending sleep</p>
<p>I’ll be able to catch her tranquil gaze</p>
<p>Unafraid and unflinching.</p>
<p>I want to be made into a mirror, so that I may reflect how things
really are.</p>
<p>I want to be made empty, so love may catch my eye, take my hand</p>
<p>And drag me into another dream.</p><br>
