<p><em>Sat/Sun Feb 18-19, 2023 - Outskirts</em></p>
<p>We landed in Delhi at around 1:20 AM and first stepped foot outside
at around 3:00. It was warm and humid, even in the dead of night. The
air was heavy, and everything was shrouded in a light fog from
pollution. The effect was beautiful and dreamlike. Our driver put his
hands together, bowed ever so slightly, and said namaste as a greeting.
Dad, Adam, and I returned the expression.</p>
<p>The trees and bushes were beautiful and green, all meticulously
arranged for the airport. We only drove maybe ten minutes, but in this I
got my first glimpse of Indian traffic. Wow! Even at this hour, cars and
tuk-tuks conflicted and the honking was ceaseless as a flock of geese
flying in circles overhead. There were occasionally lanes painted in the
street, but nobody seemed to pay them much attention. I was glad to be a
passenger, and not at the wheel! I saw a few dogs sauntering through the
trees.</p>
<p>We got to the hotel and were greeted as guests of honor. Cornell
really went all out on this; We were in the highest class hotel and
being treated like kings - quite the strange feeling, not knowing even
two words of the language or anything important about the culture. We
said goodnight to Adam and went to our room where we were served coconut
water and a plate of nuts. I didn’t have a chance to try either before I
passed out from exhaustion. </p>
<p>In the morning, Dad buzzed my hair to fix up Grace and I’s hasty
chopping. Then we went down to the breakfast area where we ate dosas and
yogurt in tiny little bowls. We departed for the Delhi airport, which
was brimming with a diversity of people. Indians of course, in beautiful
kurti and traditional clothing. Muslims with a variety of hijabs,
niqabs, and burkas. Americans were hanging around, French and Dutch folk
as well. My dad kept mentioning how he was the only guy in the airport
with shorts on, and Adam said he looked like Angus Young with the
blazer/shorts combo. This plane would only be about two hours to
Hyderabad.</p>
<p>We took off at around 3:30 PM, and I had some pleasant conversation
with a man sitting next to me who introduced himself as Paul. He saw me
reading from the Ramayana and we started talking about spiritual things.
He told me how Hindus believe in positive and negative spirits that can
influence your behavior. Negative spirits can be cleansed by simply
visiting a temple and making offerings. He suggested I visit a temple
devoted to Lord Hanuman, Ram’s monkey servant from the Ramayana. Hanuman
represents bhakti, or devotional love for God (Ram). According to Paul,
Hanuman is the only god among Hinduism’s many who stays on Earth with us
rather than residing in other heavenly realms. I asked what kind of
offerings I should make at the temple, and he suggested incense or
flowers. Paul gave me the following list as recommendations of
historical and religious places to check out in Hyderabad:</p>
<p>Charminar, Birla temple, Lumbini Park, Hussain Sagar lake, Chilkur
Balati temple (Hanuman), Keesaragutta temple (Shiva and Hanuman),
Golconda Fort, Ramoji Film City, Statue of Equality, Iskcon temple, and
Tadbund Hanuman temple.</p>
<p>Paul gave me some more facts about Hyderabad, such as how the inner,
older region is 40% Muslim, while the rest of India is only 15% Muslim.
He said there is a lot of religious harmony in Hyderabad. He also taught
me how to say thank you in Hindi: dhanyavaad.</p>
<p>We landed, and I felt very relaxed in the humid atmosphere outside. I
caught a small glimpse of the most beautiful sunset as we drove - it was
totally circular, deep maroon, and flickering through the haze of the
air pollution. More dogs hung around in small packs and the traffic was
as wild as Delhi. It was about an hour drive to our hotel in Hyderabad,
and this was my first real look at India. We passed through the slums in
the outskirts of the city, and this was (expectedly) unlike anything I
had ever seen. The poverty here is open and unashamed. Compared to New
York, with its grandiose towers, flashing brand names, and unrelenting
gentrification, which attempt to cover up the homeless population, make
them invisible - the slums slap you in the face with the reality of
poverty. Buildings here are dilapidated and falling apart, yet clearly
lived in and turned into homes. Huts are made out of sticks and clay or
fashioned out of the caverns of old warehouses. It was bustling, quite
active as people pushed through the thickets of bodies. In contrast,
there were also a lot of people just sitting or standing, not really in
any hurry. Dusty dirt roads curved endlessly into the distance and a lot
of dogs hung around at people’s feet, scratching their ears and necks. I
can make no generalizations about anything here and I don’t mean to, but
driving through, it seemed there was a sense of community - people
living with people, all observing each other’s predicaments without
judgment or fear. I suspect the difference has something to do with the
architecture. New York City was built, Hyderabad clearly grew. In New
York, the grid system was designed and enacted as planned. People can be
evicted or forced to hide as the churning machine lays pavement wherever
money calls. This leads to fear of the less-fortunate as people move
into an area and see poverty (which wasn’t a part of the lease). In
Hyderabad, the city grows from within. People can build huts and live in
the streets without being shooed away by the entrepreneurs who just
bought the land. In the slums, everyone is equal in their poverty. Take
these ramblings as you will, coming from a guy who really knows nothing
about anything! I admit that, and these are simply the thoughts that
passed through my head as we drove through the outskirts.</p>
<p>Closer to the city, the streets became packed with tuk-tuks and
motorcycles, usually with way too many people riding them to be
considered anything close to safe. Our driver, Saber, joked how this was
no traffic at all, being a Sunday. We saw the outline of the Golconda
Fort in the distance, a 1000 year old fort from the Mughal Empire. We
arrived at the hotel, and the concierge adorned us with traditional
Indian shawls and spotted our foreheads with a thumbprint of ash. With
my buzz cut, Adam said I looked like “any American kid traveling to some
ashram,” which made me laugh. </p>
<p>Later for dinner, I met Dad’s colleagues Vijay and Hema (“just say
Hey, Ma!”). I felt like an intern, walking around the hotel in a
button-up shirt and slacks, listening to them talk logistics about the
events planned for the week. We ate dinner at the hotel, which was like
a vegetarian’s heaven! I loved the roast pineapple and paneer. It’s
almost midnight now, and I feel awake and calm. It has been very easy to
do mantra or practice simple awareness on this trip so far - maybe it’s
the simplicity of travel, or perhaps elements beyond my
comprehension.</p>
<p><em>Monday Feb. 20, 2023 - Charminar</em> </p>
<p>After breakfast, Dad and I waited to meet Anil, one of Dad’s old work
friend’s brother. We met Anil and his wife Loveena in the hotel lobby at
11:00. They were an adorable couple, extremely kind and so excited to
meet an old friend of Bharat’s. Anil was friendly and very welcoming,
and Loveena never stopped smiling. I had no plan for the day at this
point, which went smoothly as it always does, for Bharat had
conveniently asked Anil to show me around Hyderabad! Dad left for his
meetings and we got in Anil’s car. First, we drove through the Eastern
Zone of Marred Bally, one of the two zones of Secunderabad, and stopped
at their apartment’s garage to pick up Loveena’s motorcycle, which is a
very efficient way to get around, since there are essentially no lanes
on the roads. Loveena met us at the convenience store they owned, and we
opened up. They were adamant in offering me drinks and all sorts of
snacks, and refused any help I offered. I was introduced to their store
neighbors, Samir and his three brothers, who owned an optical shop.
Here, Anil explained his relationship to me, which Samir mentioned was
“very convenient” for them. Anil explained his reasoning for so
willingly dropping everything to show me around, as his brother had
asked: “If we do good, we get good!”</p>
<p>I hopped on the back of Loveena’s motorcycle, with Anil driving, and
we went to a little store to get vadas (deep fried donuts filled with
lentils). Hanging on for dear life, I wondered how people were able to
sit so casually on these scooters, sometimes on their side, with two
legs hanging off the same end. Sometimes a couple would be driving a
scooter, with 2-3 kids piled on with them. With incessant beeping, we
zoomed through the traffic. I felt like such a traveler, being guided by
strangers, with the hot Indian sun directly overhead. It was
exhilarating. At the store (which Anil said was famous in Hyderabad, as
he did with every store we stopped by), a man asked me where I was from.
I said, “I’m from the United States, and you?” (my favorite joke, people
always laughed and said “India, of course!”) He was looking at me for a
while as we ate, and said “Happy Shivaratri!” (pronounced Shiva-tree)
when he left. I replied “Happy Shivaratri!” and then asked Anil what
Shivarartri meant. He said it is a festival for Lord Shiva, one of the
supreme deities in Hinduism, in which people don’t sleep for the night,
and instead hold puja ceremonies (worship rituals) all night.
Shivarartri had just passed recently. I asked Anil if we might see a
puja ceremony at one of the temples Loveena had recommended, and he said
they are usually 2-3 hours long, with all the mantras and such. If I was
keen we could go, if I was very very keen, we may go. He seemed not keen
at all, so I decided to not press it.</p>
<p>We scooted back to the store and gave Loveena her food, then left in
his car to go to the Charminar, the landmark symbol of Hyderabad. We
drove through much of Hyderabad, and Anil pointed out many of the famous
temples, churches, and schools along the way, as well as the street
carts set up by the state government where people can buy a full lunch
for 5 rupees (equivalent to 6 US cents!) We drove through the area of
Tag Bund, where there was a Hanuman temple Paul had mentioned on the
plane, and the area of Abids. The streets were packed with people
working stands and selling their wares (usually shoes, vehicle parts, or
fresh fruit), old men wandering between cars asking for alms, dogs
poking through trash for food (their tails, notably, never stopped
wagging), cows and goats chained to fences with signs that read “Dairy
Farm”, and so much more life I could never begin to accurately describe
with words. Driving through the city, it really felt like a
self-perpetuating system was at work, where the people just did their
thing. There were hardly any police, and everyone seemed to treat each
other with respect as they focused entirely on their own work (or
survival). Everyone’s work was totally intertwined with everyone else’s
- there was no escape from the cycle. I was interested in the equanimity
of everyone’s faces: Shoe seller, tuk-tuk driver, and beggar alike all
shared a face of total neutrality with a slight positive in the edges of
their lips and eyes. Maybe it was due to feeling imprisoned and helpless
in their poverty, but I think it may have been due to the determination
of fulfilling whatever task was directly facing them - with not enough
time or money or need to think ahead of it. It was around a forty minute
drive due to the traffic, and on the way Anil gave me some advice: Don’t
give your belongings to anyone, and don’t talk to strangers. I asked him
what Hyderabadi thought of Americans, and he just shrugged and said, no
worries, but they may fool you around.</p>
<p>We found a place to park and I could see the impressive Charminar up
ahead, maybe a mile away. We were now in the Old City, a 1000 year old
city with a large Muslim population and a very large general population
as well. I thought Times Square could get crowded, but this was
something entirely different. People overflowed the already small
sidewalks and blended into the streets, walking almost like liquid
through the scooters and cars. Compared to outer Hyderabad, where many
people wore western-style clothing, though some women tended to wear
traditional Indian garb, this inner region was extremely diverse. Monks
walked the streets, carrying staffs and water jugs. Old Arabic men wore
their long white robes and colored scarves and turbans. Many women wore
hijabs, with a good amount of women and girls in all black niqabs.
Little boys in matching Taqiyah caps and blue and white patterned kurtas
tugged at my pants, asking for coins. Anil grabbed my arm and led me
through the bazaar, saying Come, James! Come! He held my hand as we
walked through the bazaar leading up to the Charminar, making sure I
didn’t slip away in the crowd and disappoint his older brother. No
traffic was allowed in the bazaar, and people sold all kinds of items-
mostly bags, jewelry, sugarcane juice, and women’s clothing. It was
clear at this point that I was the only Westerner in all of Hyderabad. A
lot of people just stared, some introduced themselves and shook my hand,
little kids stopped playing to look at me, and we exchanged big, goofy
smiles. There was a small temple beneath the massive Charminar dedicated
to Lakshmi (sometimes written as Laxmi) the Hindu goddess of wealth and
fortune, wife of Shiva. We didn’t go in, but Anil and I could see the
beautiful icon of Lakshmi, carved from white stone and surrounded by
flowers and incense, from outside. We stopped for a moment and put our
hands together, bowing our heads slightly, and prayed to the deity. </p>
<p>Entering the Charminar, Anil (very insistently!) paid for our
tickets- foreigners: 300 rupees, locals: 25. The Charminar is an ancient
mosque built 400 years ago, one of the largest mosques in India. Its
four tall pillars are dazzling in the bright sun, and it stands tall and
proud above the bustling bazaar. We climbed a steep spiral staircase to
the top, and looked out over the beautiful city-scape. From here,
detached from the first-person perspective, the bazaar scene was like an
incredible mosaic sprawling and writhing. People moved like lungs,
emulating the deep breathing of a bustling city. Across from the
Charminar was the Masjid Mosque, another beautiful mosque carved from
the same stone hundreds of years ago. </p>
<p>We descended, and walked back through the bazaar where Anil bought me
a little tourist tote bag. We went to a little store and got biscuits
and Hyderabadi tea, which can only be made by Hyderabadi according to
Anil. It was similar to the chai masala I had at the hotel in the
morning, but it was richer and even more delicious. </p>
<p>Being with Anil was a great opportunity to break certain personal and
cultural attachments. He absolutely refused to let me pay for anything,
which was hard because I had hundreds of rupees on me and I didn’t want
to be a financial burden. He was way more stubborn than I was, and I
learned to just accept it and be treated. He was also very touchy, and
took a ton of selfies, which made me feel a little uncomfortable. Maybe
it was just him, or maybe a brother’s old friend’s son is considered
close enough for hand-holding and the like. Either way, I decided to
just let him be my guide for the day, knowing he was fulfilled in
following his older brother’s directions to show me around.</p>
<p>Next, we drove to the Salar Jung museum, a nearby art museum filled
with statues and paintings from all over the world, mostly the 15th and
16th century. We arrived at 4:30 and it closed at 5:00, so Anil led me
through the whole museum in this time. At this point, Anil had gotten a
bit grouchy and seemed to want to check this one off the list and drop
me back at the hotel, so we practically sprinted through the museum. We
passed by rooms filled with ivory carvings, beautiful wooden sculptures
of Buddhas and gods, impressive diamond-encrusted swords and talwars.
This was another chance to let go and learn to flow with it all. I
would’ve loved to spend those 30 minutes in just one of the rooms and
take it all in, rather than rush and see everything in just a blink.
Well, that’s what I would’ve wanted. Who’s that, anyway? We learned that
there was a music show to occur at 5:00. I was so excited to experience
some live music here! We found ourselves in a wide room with maybe a
hundred people seated in chairs, and a lot sitting on the ground up
front. Perfectly centered in front of the crowd was a golden clock.
Everyone was hushed and attentive in the minutes leading up to 5:00. I
didn’t see any musicians or instruments, but I brought myself to full
attention as well. At 5:00, a little bearded toy-man crept into view
from inside the golden clock, and with a little toy-hammer struck the
cymbal five times. It made a deep, resounding sound with each strike.
The crowd erupted into applause, then got up to leave. It was quite the
musical show, a one-man-clock-band!</p>
<p>Anil dropped me off at the hotel and we said goodbye. I took a walk
on a path by the hotel, and watched the hazy red sun set over the
Hussain Sagar lake. I finally understood how one might describe the sun
to be “unruly”, as John Donne did in his poem “The Sun Rising”. I’ll
have to tell my friend Marty, who once showed me the poem and pondered
its meaning. </p>
<p>“I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink, But that I would not
lose her sight so long; If her eyes have no blinded thine, Look, and
tomorrow late, tell me, Whether both th’ Indias of spice and mine Be
where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.” - The Sun Rising</p><br><br>

<p><em>Tuesday Feb. 21, 2023 - Birla and Buddha</em></p>
<p>I woke up early this morning and went to breakfast with Dad, Adam,
and Miguel. We had dosas, strawberry yogurt, and chai masala tea. I had
asked the concierge if it was safe to walk along the road to the Birla
Temple, which I had gotten many recommendations for. He said it would be
best to avoid it, since the sidewalks are almost nonexistent and
rickshaws, motorcycles, and buses speed along the roads. Adam, however,
said he had almost reached the temple while running in the early
morning, and thought it was doable. I decided to take the walk, and set
out on my first solo adventure in Hyderabad! </p>
<p>Walking alongside the Hussain Sagar lake in the early morning was an
incredible experience. The sun was not so harsh, and its rays reflected
on the lake like a lighthouse. There was a lovely green path next to the
main road, which was already packed with traffic. I took the path, which
was made up of gentle winding stepping stones. Little chipmunks darted
around, and Indian crows, which are slim and a little shiny, sang in the
trees. Many people were sleeping in the grass or benches, one sandal
tucked behind their heads for support. Some people were meditating in
the sun, some doing mantras, and one guy was doing some intense pranayam
(breathing exercises), his whole torso expanding and contracting
repeatedly in very rapid succession. I felt so calm, singing Sri Ram
under my breath and enjoying every step. Eventually, I came to a huge
roundabout in the road, where cars looped through side by side.. by side
by side by side.. by side. There were maybe 10 “lanes” of traffic going
through the intersection at once! As I pondered how I might get through
this, a little old man with a wooden walking stick passed me from behind
and stepped foot into the road. He never slowed his pace, and just
walked straight through the speeding rickshaws and motorcycles - he
literally just walked straight and somehow ended up on the other side of
the road without being crushed by anything! I suspect this is a
superpower one gains from living a full life in Hyderabad. Hugging the
edge of the road, I followed a curve to the left and found an easier
place to cross. Here, the streets were smaller but just as crowded. I
walked for a while on a little sidewalk that was maybe a foot across.
This was a very active street, with many shops starting to open and
people chopping sugarcane for the blender. Many of the shops were
propped up out of concrete holes in the walls of old dilapidated
buildings. Many people lay on the ground on the sidewalk or behind small
fences. I crossed the street again, and noticed a young guy opening up
his flower shop. I was planning on finding something along the way, like
incense or flowers, to make offerings at Birla Mandir. I said namaste to
the shopkeeper, and asked for some flowers. He said no English, Sir, and
I pointed to a bouquet of red roses. He said 350 rupees. I didn’t want
the whole bouquet so I said, 100 rupees? and he nodded and began to cut
some flowers for me. He meticulously cut five roses, stripped their
thorns, and wrapped them with some leafy grass, and finally some red
plastic wrapping. He was an impeccable florist. </p>
<p>I kept walking, now down some side roads rather than the busy main
street. Three dogs were hanging out next to a security guard, leaning
back in his little chair. Some women collected trash off the sidewalks
with big straw brooms. I missed a turn, and retracing my steps, entered
the Adarsh Nagar Welfare Society. This was the first street I walked in
Hyderabad that resembled something like a suburban neighborhood - I
think it was a richer area because it was so close to the temple. There
were few people on the streets here - just some garbage trucks and an
old man taking his grandson around on a motorbike. A brown cat walked
by. It was a peaceful walk, a slight uphill climb. I followed signs that
pointed to Birla Temple, and came to a little market place where people
sold treats and souvenirs. I turned the corner and saw the temple ahead
of me. On top of the hill (called Naubath Pahad), I only saw a small
section of the temple, but its pure white marble was already
breathtaking. </p>
<p>I walked up to the shoe rack and took off my shoes and socks and gave
them to a guy who put them in a little cubby. He gave me a cardboard
strip with a number on it in return. Then I walked over to a locker area
and gave another guy my phone, and he put it away and gave me a metal
tag in return. He said, “one” and I agreed. He kept saying “one” and I
wasn’t sure what he meant, so I left and started up the temple. I rolled
up my pants so as not to drag the ends on the ground. The feeling of my
bare feet on the cool, pure white marble made me giddy. I could already
feel a powerful spiritual energy (shakti) nearly throbbing from the air
itself, and I couldn’t stop smiling. The first temple was dedicated to
Saraswati, a goddess of knowledge, art, and music. The shrine was like a
small room with two open doors in front. The statue of Saraswati was
dressed in beautiful traditional Indian clothing with incredible colors
and jewels. She had many arms, and flower petals were tossed around her
feet. A priestess (pujari) was attending a smaller shrine next to it,
lighting incense and arranging petals. I put my hands together and
slightly bowed my head as others were doing. I stayed for a while, and
left a rose as an offering. I continued up more marble steps to the next
shrine, which was dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and the
wife of Vishnu. The next was Ganesh, the elephant god. I meditated with
my hands together and left flowers at each. My mind was totally empty.
Beside me, a woman gave a coconut to an attendant, who cracked it open
and gave her the two halves. She tossed them in the shrine as an
offering. </p>
<p>There were a lot of bananas on the ground of the next shrine. Ah,
here he was: Hanuman! Hanuman’s shrine was the simplest of the shrines I
had seen so far. He was only one color, orange, and only bananas and
marigold petals lay at his feet. I stayed here for a long time, and I
didn’t leave any flowers. </p>
<p>I started to climb some wide marble stairs up to the main temple. The
sun was beating relentlessly, and it shone brilliantly on lush flowers,
trees, and bushes. I could see the lake, and the statue of the Buddha,
even the hotel far away. All of Hyderabad stretched out to my right, and
to my left, Birla Mandir. There was a white marble statue of Krishna
dancing beside a cow amidst the flowers, red and yellow. I entered the
temple where depictions of scenes I recognized from the Mahabharata and
Bhagavad Gita were carved into the stone on the walls. There was a
little pavilion to the side where many people were sitting and hanging
out. I kept climbing more stairs and reached the top, where I walked
clockwise behind the main temple, taking in the incredible view and
lovely marble. Outside the main temple many people were sitting and
meditating in the small area of shade it provided. One white guy was
seated in the lotus position chanting a mantra. Up here, way above
Hyderabad among many meditators and devotees, shakti was strong. </p>
<p>I kept walking in the clockwise direction until I reached the
entrance to the main temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu in the form of Sri
Venkateswara. In the entrance, there were two wooden statues, Jaya and
Vajaya, maybe eight feet tall each on pedestals. Eye level with their
knees, I followed the people in front of me in rubbing their feet. I
finally entered the main temple, where the huge avatar of Vishnu resided
in an inner sanctum. People walked very slowly here, and stayed in front
of the deity with their hands together for maybe a minute before moving
on to allow others to pray. Another pujari was here, an older man
wearing a white robe that covered half his chest. He had two vertical
white stripes of paint on his face. I put out my right hand and he
poured water on it from a steel ladle. He said, this is Holy water, you
drink it. I drank it, and he said very good. Welcome. I left the main
temple and meditated in the shade for a while. </p>
<p>Walking down the steps, I met two college-aged guys named Charan and
Kiran! They were funny guys and we got along well pretty quickly. They
spoke great English, and we had little trouble communicating. They asked
me where I was from and I told them United States, and you? They were
Hyderabadis and had lived there their whole lives and knew some good
spots, which they wrote in my notebook for me. They were studying for
their English proficiency exams, and if they passed they would have a
chance to study abroad in the US. They wanted to go to Texas! Charan did
most of the talking, Kiran was quiet. After talking for a while about
what we did and who we were, we walked down the rest of the steps to
retrieve our shoes and phones and traded numbers. I told them I had
walked 45 minutes to get here, and Charan offered me a ride back to the
hotel on his motorcycle! I was planning on hanging around the area some
more, but I couldn’t pass up another scooter ride. Kiran went to
retrieve the bike, and I hopped on, with Charan behind me. The ride was
exhilarating! We flew down the dirt roads back onto the main street, and
cruised alongside the lake, chatting a little but mostly just enjoying
the ride. Charan said he would teach me how to drive a motorcycle if I
taught him guitar, which I readily agreed to. We got back to the hotel
and they dropped me off, with plans to go adventuring the next day. I
went in and had lunch with my dad, and I went to take a short nap. I
underestimated how tired I was, and I woke up four hours later! </p>
<p>In the evening, Dad and I met Vijey’s daughter Thapasya, who was very
nice and recommended I check out some live music in an area called
Jubilee Hills, a hip part of town in western Hyderabad. She arranged for
a driver, Ranesh, to take us to the giant Buddha statue in the center of
Hussain Sagar lake. Ranesh drove us to Lumbini Park where we could take
a boat to the statue. We parked and walked through some wild traffic to
the park, where we paid 25 rupees each for access. There were vendors
and food, a small drop tower, and a little water park for kids. A little
boy grabbed his parents and pointed at us excitedly saying Americans!
Americans! Ranesh said he’d meet us back at the park, and we paid 50
rupees each for a boat ticket. It was very crowded, and we waited in
line for a while. On the boat, we saw a pretty fountain show with blue,
pink, and green lights criss-crossing across the spouting water while
the Mission Impossible theme played repeatedly. The boat docked at the
island, and we looked at the Buddha for a while. According to a plaque
there, this statue is the largest monolithic statue of Siddhartha
Guatama in the country. It was carved out of a single granite rock by 40
sculptors led by the architect Ganapati Stapathi. It weighs 320 tons and
is 17 meters tall. It was a great statue and it was a nice place to
visit with my dad.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday Feb. 22, 2023 - Golconda Fort</em></p>
<p>This morning I had breakfast with dad and Miguel, who said he was
interested in walking to Birla Manir in the early morning the next day,
and I asked to go with him. I couldn’t pass up another chance to see the
magnificent temple! At 9:00, Ranesh picked me up, with a big smile on
his face as usual. Today’s plan was to visit the Golconda Fort, an
ancient fortress built in the 11th century in the western outskirts of
Hyderabad. We drove for around thirty minutes, with Ranesh pointing out
many places and facts along the way. He told me that India’s summer was
coming up and would last from March to May. After that, the rainy season
would last from June to August, but the seasons had been overlapping
recently due to climate change. It was 25 degrees celsius, and would get
up to 35 in the next few hours. We could see the impressive stone
fortress looming in the distance as we drove. </p>
<p>We waited for a while at a dangerous curve where scooters and
rickshaws flew around the corner out of nowhere. We finally got the
signal, and drove around the bend through a tunnel. We came out on a
busy intersection, with lots of people shouting and bartering. The
entrance to the fort was here, and Ranesh dropped me on the side of the
road. I walked over to the entrance and followed some other people going
in, and paid for my ticket. I bought a map from a guy for 50 rupees. A
man with deep red eyes approached me and introduced himself as a tour
guide, and offered to be my guide for no money, sir! I didn’t really
want a guide, and when I told him that his face sank in despair - then
quickly lit back up again as he continued to describe how I could never
see the whole fort without a guide, how I would get lost, and so on.
Suddenly I heard my name being called. Behind a fence to my right maybe
30 feet away was Ranesh! “James! You don’t have to take a guide!” he
shouted. I gave my protector a thumbs up and started on the path. </p>
<p>I entered the Gate of Balahisar. The tour guide, who was following
me, pointed me to a spot in the center and signaled for me to clap. I
clapped, and the sound was like a clap of lightning. It was a wobbly
sound, I could picture it making oblong waves along the walls. My
nonconsensual guide pointed up to the very peak of the fort, where I
could see a shining white four-pillared mosque pretty far in the
distance. My guide said that the architecture of this fort was designed
in such a way that a clap from this exact spot would reverberate along
the walls all the way up to the Shah. I kept walking and eventually
shook him off, where another tour guide immediately intercepted me. I
gave him 50 rupees to leave me alone and started climbing the
steps. </p>
<p>By now it was extremely hot, and the sun pounded on the orange stone.
I realized that unlike important monuments in other countries, there was
nobody around to really stop me from exploring. So I took the most
inconvenient routes, scrabbling up cliffs and gates, edging along the
ramparts, and ducking under shaded canals. The fortress was massive and
it was easy to get lost. I felt like Lara Croft. </p>
<p>I passed by the entrance to a dark room with a sign that read
“Ramadas Prison’’, and decided to come back to it. I wanted to reach the
peak first. I continued up the steps of Balahisar, and stopped at many
points to sit and dangle my legs, looking out at the full scope of the
city. I could see all of Hyderabad beyond the gates, and inside I could
see the crumbled tombs and cannons, as well as lovely gardens and dirt
paths sprawling through dense woods. Nearing the peak, I came across a
beautiful little temple tucked beneath two giant twin boulders - the Sri
Jagadamba temple. There were two paintings of a deity with its tongue
sticking out holding two ropes above its head on both sides of the
entrance. Beautiful paintings of Laksmhi with many arms adorned the
walls. I could see a pujari tending to the shrine, as well as a little
girl, maybe seven, playing with some pebbles. I took off my shoes and
socks and walked up the steps and prayed at the shrine while the pujari
arranged incense. I stayed for a while.</p>
<p>I heard a lot of voices behind me and turned to see a large crowd of
Americans taking a tour. I descended the steps and watched as they ran
up to take photos with the paintings, completely ignoring the small
voice of their tour guide saying please, your shoes. It is a temple… I
made sure the guide could see me putting my socks and shoes back on.
Yes, I was not insensitive like them, I knew how this worked! I then
realized what I was doing and felt ashamed, and then started giggling.
It seems a certain vanity I have been attempting to deflate has only
changed form into what Chögyam Trungpa would call the spiritual ego.
Clearly I have a lot of work to do! </p>
<p>I kept walking up the steps to the final peak which was called
Baradari, or Darbar Hall. It was a double storied building with open
terraces and a fantastic 360 degree view of the fortress and Hyderabad.
The lower two stories are called Diwani-I-Khas and Diwani-Am, and were
audience halls for guests from the ancient times. I bought a water
bottle from some guys at a stand.</p>
<p>I started walking back down, planning to plunge into the tombs and
eventually the forest path I had seen. However, I was drawn back to the
Jagadamba temple, and I took my shoes off again to go back inside. This
time, there was an older man alongside the mother/daughter pujari duo I
saw the first time. He was inside the inner sanctum (the garbhagriha)
where the idol of the deity (the murti) resides, chanting in very rapid
Hindi. The woman pujari was doing a different mantra, hers repetitive,
his not. I realized he was performing a puja ceremony which, in a
temple, is a worship ritual for the deity. An older couple was praying
outside the shrine and I joined them. The old priest in the sanctum
motioned for us to come inside the shrine, so I followed the couple and
sat on my knees as they did. The little girl was playing a matching game
with some toys. </p>
<p>The old pujari was doing all sorts of things in the shrine as he
rapidly spoke mantras. He smashed a coconut in half and poured its water
into a copper bowl, then drew three lines of orange powder, and three of
red powder on one half of the shell. He lit incense and arranged fruits
and flowers. He asked my name, and included it in his mantras. It was a
very interesting process, and I was captivated. This went on for maybe
20 minutes, and eventually he offered us smoke from the incense, which
we used both hands to wave into our faces three times. Next, he motioned
for us to lean forward, where he placed a tilak mark on our foreheads
with the orange kumkuma (powder). Then, he wrapped a small piece of
orange and red string around our right wrists which he had ripped during
the ceremony. Finally, he offered us the holy water which he had been
mixing during the ceremony, which we received with our right hands and
brought to our lips to drink. Compared to the holy water from Birla,
this was very flavorful in ways I can’t describe. The old man then
reached into the sanctum and pulled out a banana, which he tore in two
and gave me a half of. I ate it and put the peel in my pocket with plans
to leave it somewhere fitting, and left the temple with the older
couple. </p>
<p>I put my shoes back on and started down the steps. Wow! and Holy
shit! were my only thoughts. I came upon Ramada’s Prison again and went
in this time. It was a dark, wet room dimly lit by a single candle on a
terrace up some steep stone steps. I motioned to a guy there asking if I
could go up, and he nodded and pointed at my feet. I took my shoes off
and climbed the steps. Another shrine! This was a tiny shrine, just a
candle and copper incense holders and a wreath of flowers on the wall.
The guy came up with me and told me to pray. He asked where I was from,
and noticing my tilak, he said good. Very good! I left Ramada’s Prison
and descended the hill. I came across another tiny shrine under a stone,
with a painting of Hanuman, dancing and smiling. Perfect, I thought,
placing the banana peel on the ground for him.</p>
<p>I sat by the garden for a while before entering the tombs, which were
dark and humid. As soon as I entered, the stench of.. bird shit? was
overwhelming. It smelled just like the bird breeder where I got my pet
Tango years and years ago. As I walked I started to hear an incredibly
loud chittering, like gossiping fairies talking over each other. In the
darkness, I stopped short at a dropoff of maybe 30 feet. Here, the
stench and chittering were at their peak. Suddenly, a small black thing
with wings darted past my face. Oh! I looked up and saw a churning mass
of blackness, like a gooey jello turning over on itself, throbbing,
breathing. Oh! Of course! I turned on my phone’s flashlight and pointed
it straight up - hundreds and hundreds of bats were roosting on the
cavern’s ceiling! More of them started flying out, and I turned off my
light and stood for a while, listening to their chirping and watching
the shapes they made as they climbed over one another. </p>
<p>I kept on going through the tombs for a while and eventually found my
way on top of them. I walked along a long open terrace to the side of
the road, which was maybe 50 feet below me. It was a dirt road and
motorcycles flew by. There was a little neighborhood here made of tiny
cement houses. An old woman hung her laundry on a line and a little boy
played with a toy truck in the sand.</p>
<p>I descended a spiral staircase and finally came to the forest path I
had seen from the fortress. I walked along the path for a while - the
forestry and vines were very different from the woods back home, but
woods are woods - it felt very familiar to me. After a few fascinating
hours, I finally left the fort and called Naresh to come pick me up.</p>
<p>Driving back, I asked Naresh to take me to his favorite place to eat,
but he was worried I would get sick. We were driving through some very
populated and very poor areas, and at one point we were stopped for a
long while at a red light. Three similar pairs of people were walking
through the stopped traffic in different areas, tapping on the windows
asking for money. Each pair was made up of a woman in a hijab or niqab,
who tapped on the windows while leading a man. Each man they led had
some kind of bodily disfigurement - broken arms in handmade casts at the
best, and mangled, twisted limbs or no limbs at the worst. I watched as
one woman forcefully thrusted one of the man’s disfigured arms onto the
window of a car that would not give. I looked straight ahead as Naresh
did when one pair came to our car and tapped on my window. I felt like
my heart was breaking with each tap. Eventually I couldn’t keep ignoring
them, and I turned to meet their eyes. Naresh saw me turn and silently
handed me a few rupee coins. I rolled down the window a little; The
string on my wrist felt tight as I dropped the coins into the woman’s
outstretched hand. </p>
<p>Back at the hotel, I had lunch by myself and waited for Charan to
stop by. Charan was planning on getting his masters in supply chain
management and wanted to talk to my dad about the topic. I got two
chocolate ice cream cones and brought them outside to meet Charan. When
they arrived I gave him and his friend Siddu the ice cream. We chatted
for a bit in the lobby with a woman from Arkansas, and I attempted one
of their English practice exams. Eventually, my dad came down and talked
to them for a while. They were very impressed with his position and
status and asked how they could be like him - to which he said work
hard! Charan and Siddu left, and we planned to meet tomorrow to get
biryani. I went to sleep for a while, and in the evening I joined the
Cornell/Sathguru team in visiting a few supermarkets in the newer part
of the city.</p>

<p><em>Thursday Feb. 23, 2023 - Ghazal</em></p>
<p>This morning, Dad and I met Adam and Miguel in the lobby at 6:00 with
plans to walk to Birla Manir and visit the temple. I remembered the way,
and we walked in the darkness of the early morning along the lake. Many
people were already awake and running, sitting, or doing yoga in the
grass. One guy was masturbating under a blanket. We walked for a while,
crossing the busy intersections and watched the sun start to rise. This
early in the morning, it was quiet, and trash was strewn around the
streets and sidewalks. Grinning dogs scampered around, and we saw a tiny
cat sitting under a statue. Getting closer, we could hear beautiful
chanting coming from up the hill. We made it to the temple entrance and
had to wait a little for it to open.</p>
<p>At 7:00, we entered the temple and checked our shoes and phones in.
There were a few people here and there but other than that it was very
empty. Miguel was very interested in the shrines, and I explained what I
could about the deities and their symbols. I didn’t want to keep
everyone up, but I prayed for a while at the Hanuman shrine. Climbing
the marble stairs, the rising sun in the East was beautifully white and
pure. In the main temple, I pointed out the depictions of the Bhagavad
Gita and Mahabharata carved into the marble. We watched falcons soar in
the sky and sacred scarab beetles crawl on the marble engravings. </p>
<p>After walking another 2 miles back, we had breakfast at the hotel. I
was exhausted and went to sleep for a while. I read from the Ramayana
outside in the shade. </p>
<p>In the evening, there was a dinner outside in a garden with the
Cornell/Sathguru squad. When I got to the garden there were two guys
playing Indian classical music! I sat up close and listened. One guy was
playing the tabla, two drums that had five unique pitches. Vijey
explained to me that there are five notes in Indian music: Re, ga, ma,
dha, and ni. The drums were decorated with strings and beads, and the
head was made of calfskin. Another guy was playing a santoor, the oldest
known string instrument in India. It has 100 strings in many sets, and
it is played by lightly tapping the strings with two wooden sticks,
making a sound similar to harmonics on a guitar. The pair improvised for
a bit, then they played some traditional Hindu songs that my friend Toib
recognized and loved. He clapped along (the rhythms were incredibly
fluid, the tempo changing with nearly every accentuation and a meter
that I couldn’t keep up with). Toib said the genre was called ghazal,
which invokes a similar feeling to sad violins. It was lovely
music. </p>
<p><em>Fri/Sat/Sun Feb. 24-26, 2023 - Chennai</em></p>
<p>The past few days flew by! It’s currently Monday, February 27 and I’m
on the plane with my dad going to JFK from Paris. On Friday, we said our
goodbyes to the friends we made in Hyderabad: Adam, Miguel, Vijey,
Thapasya, Naresh, Charan, Toib and everyone. We got a ride to the
airport and took off for Chennai, about an hour and a half to the south
where dad’s old friend Sawan was going to pick us up. We met Sawan, and
he gave us a “traditional Indian welcome” by wrapping our necks with
huge garlands of marigolds. He drove us through Chennai to a hotel where
he dropped us off. Chennai was a lot less crowded than Hyderabad, and
very humid. It was quiet in the dark of night. </p>
<p>The next day, Dad and I played cards for a while outside by a
peaceful pond, waiting for Sawan. He came around 2:00, and we met his
son Shivane, 13, who was quiet at first but warmed up quickly. He was
learning guitar and, taking a big influence from his father, was working
on his own content-creation business. We drove for about an hour down
the East Coast Road, taking in the lovely ocean view. Sawan made us
delicious sandwiches which we ate in the car. We stopped by the Madras
Crocodile Bank which was a tiny zoo housing 14 different species of
alligators! We poked our way between crowds of uniformed kids on a
school trip to see the gators, while Sawan and Dad caught up,
reminiscing on old times. We got to the hotel (which Sawan’s family
company had done the lighting for), and were greeted by a literal
sounding of a celestial conch. Well, maybe it wasn’t celestial, but the
hotel manager and his squad sounded the horn after draping us in
necklaces made of sea shells and shading us with a palm tree. This was
definitely not just “some ashram” that Adam thought I’d fit right into -
Sawan was a high-class guy.</p>
<p>We checked into our rooms and then left to go see the sights along
the East Coast Road. It was a lovely road to drive through - shaded
paths meandered between dense oceanic woods, kids played with
hand-crafted bows and arrows in the dust, and groups of teenagers
sweated under the sun playing cricket. The more populous areas had a lot
of stands and shops like Hyderabad, but the ocean-side focus made it
seem very relaxed and care-free. We picked up a tour-guide on the way,
who claimed to speak 16 languages! He showed us the first of the many
Mahabalipuram Ruins, the Panchapandava Cave Temples, which Sawan said
were built by the Pandavas in the 7th century. To my understanding, the
five Pandava brothers lived around 5000 years ago, so I think these were
built to honor them. There were many temples that we could go inside and
surprisingly, even climb on. There were people all over the place,
scaling the carefully carved walls and taking pictures. Our guide said
that these were all carved from the same massive stone over a period of
200 years, starting from the top. Inside the only finished temple,
dedicated to Lord Shiva, I could feel the ancient energies in my bones.
We drove a little more and got out to see two more sites: Arjuna’s
Penance and Krishna’s Butter Ball. We walked through the crowded streets
and came to a grassy area where people and dogs were hanging out. Up
ahead was Arjuna’s Penance, a massive stone carving that Sawan described
as “India’s Mount Rushmore.” It was an incredible carving from the 7th
century that depicted a scene from the Mahabharata: the descent of the
sacred river Ganges to earth from heaven. Carvings of the sun and moon,
Arjuna performing austerities on one leg, elephants, snake goddesses,
Vishnu, kings and gods, are all fabulously displayed on the monolith. It
left me breathless. Next was Krishna’s Butter Ball, which has no real
connection to Krishna. Krishna’s Butter Ball is a gigantic boulder
resting in a very precarious position. It looks like it should tumble
and vanquish anything in its wake with the slightest touch, but it
stands firm. Our guide told us that once, during the time of the British
Empire, 12 elephants tried and failed to knock it over. Finally, we
looked at the Shore Temple, but did not go in since Sawan had gotten us
massages we had to get to. As we walked back to the car, Shivane told me
this temple would be underwater soon, as there were other temples just
like this that were already beneath the waves. I tried not to be
bothered that we missed this chance for a massage. On the way out, Dad
got me some sandals from a shoe-maker on the street. The guy asked for
2,500 rupees, and Sawan haggled him down to 1,400, which Sawan thought
was still more than double their worth.</p>
<p>We returned to the hotel and got the massages, and then got ready to
have dinner with Sawan’s friends, the owners of the hotel. We met them
at the beach with their daughter Amaira and had dinner at a table in the
sand. The adults talked business and related things while Amaira,
Shivane and I hung out at our end of the table. We talked about music
and poetry and stars (a different constellation season here than in the
US!) It was nice to have such good company for just the night. The
owners and Amaira left, offering me a place to stay if I ever returned
to India (which I definitely plan to), and Sawan agreed to host me as
well. I think I’ll be more inclined to actually visit an ashram rather
than stay with the elites of the country, but it was very nice of them.
We played our little games well, and they departed happily. Sawan had
Shivane go back to their room and retrieve his cigars (“45 minute
smokes!”), which he and my dad shared. </p>
<p>I put my feet in the water and stared out at the vast Indian
ocean.</p>
