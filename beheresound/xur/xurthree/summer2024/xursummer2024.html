This was our first real TOUR. June 18th to July 7th with SAUCE. Here's a recap.<br><br>

Day 1: Meatlocker. I forgot the mask in Matteo's basement. We crashed at my Uncle Mike's. Thanks dude! Flyer by Dead Reagan Booking, pic by Jack.<br><br>

<br><br>The next couple days were a blur. Mutator was a dope distillery. Cullen the guy who ran the place gave us free samples. Thanks Cullen! We camped at a Christmas tree farm somewhere in Lancaster. <br><br>

We landed in the fabled land of Kalamazoo, Michigan for an incredible double-header of sweaty nights 
with Means of Entry. They made these flyers, Gavin made the Doom City one.<br><br>

After Kalamazoo I think we lost all sense of past present and future. We played shows. We slept outside. We drove West.<br><br>
Jack, somewhere.<br><br>

With enough spiritual experiences and esctatic memories to last a lifetime,
 but still hungry for more, we turned back East. Brain Graffiti and the Mirror folks set up this skatepark show in Champaign, IL
  which is where we met Megan, our saxophonist. She and Keaton hopped in the van and we gained two members to the crew. Pics by Austin Corley @cameracorley.<br><br>

Back home, James Wise made this recap and began promoting the barn show.<br><br>
<img src="./yaptourrecap.jpg"><br><br>
More days passed. I don't remember many specifics, but I remember when Henry said, "I think we found ourselves." I couldn't agree more.<br><br>
<img src="../flyers/halfbaked.jpg"><br><br>
Finally we made it back to the barn. I tore up my mask and it meant something. 
 We stopped by Henry's and picked up the homemade mead we had been brewing. You know how nothing's perfect in this world except in love letters and skewed retrospection? 
 This night changed my mind. Happy, happy, happy! It was flawless, beautiful, vibrant. <br><br>
 The next day we hiked Pinnacle mountain and I never cried harder. That night when I closed my eyes, I swear I saw the end credits roll.<br><br>
 So the tour was over but we weren't done playing shows just yet. Two more closed the summer: A matinee at Trouble Girl's house and a South Whitney party to round it out. Bristol flyer by Great Frog Society, South Whitney flyer by Zakky Wildcard.<br><br>

Will King captured the South Whitney show on his camcorder. Thanks Will!<br><br>

The end.
