  <p><center><b><p>Introduction</p></b></center></p>
  <p>In late January 2025 I very briefly heard the sounds of the muladhara
  (the earth center at the base of the spine), and the svadhisthana (the
  water center of the sacrum). Later that night, I described it in my
  notebook:  </p>
  <p>“Perfectly still with calmness of breath (OM Peace Amen) / Breathing
  in the light of ether and exhaling misinterpretation / The first sound
  awakens gently. Flickering candle suspended – the plume of incense smoke
  softly rising / Subtle vibrating motion around the golden bowl, slowly,
  scraping / A resonance unfolding. Merge with it – the voice of
  repetition. Steady now / The second sound is on a wholly different
  vibrational rate. Snowy, bright blue twinkling like icicle wind chimes
  in a cosmic breeze / Listen in the right ear, the positive receiving
  side of the body. Listen closely, further in, further in – words are
  just too smudgy now! I’m writing all over it, 1000 ‘its’ in this single
  pencil stroke. 1000 astral flutes sing their perfect chord – So the
  Cosmic Bard plays the Song of the Lord.” </p>
  <p>The sounds were incredibly subtle, delicate, and easily banished by a
  single restless thought. I can’t recreate the sounds with instruments,
  in words, or in my head – but they are present in my consciousness
  nonetheless. Here are some more examples: </p>
  <p>In “I Heard Whales (I Think)” by Mount Eerie, Phil Elverum describes
  the sound of “the real thing”: </p>
  <p>“Walking slowly back and forth / On a bluff along the water / Seeing
  waves roll in the blowing / Far from any other person / I swear / I
  promise / I heard, I did / I heard actual music riding on the wind /
  Barely there / Though it couldn’t have been/ ’Cause I was definitely
  miles from any other people / And crashing water in my ears eclipsed
  everything / It sounded like… It could’ve been whales / Deep, watching,
  doing their singing / It could’ve been some ancient shipwreck / Still
  out there howling / Or it could’ve been science / Just wind and waves
  and rocks and angles / Or my hallucination could have been / The real
  thing / Something with no explanation / Heard, or not heard, inside of
  everything / And there is music no one hears / Unless they quiet all the
  way down / <a href="https://genius.com/33575152/Mount-eerie-i-heard-whales-i-think/And-there-is-music-no-one-hears-unless-they-quiet-all-the-way-down-and-lean-way-out-over-the-edge">And
  lean way out over the edge</a>“ </p>
  <p>Russian mystic Madame Blavatsky described the seven sacred sounds as
  such: </p>
  <p>“The first is like the nightingale’s sweet voice, chanting a parting
  song to its mate. The next resembles the sound of silver cymbals of the
  Dhyanis, awakening the twinkling stars. It is followed by the plain
  melodies of the ocean’s spirit imprisoned in a conch shell, which in
  turn gives place to the chant of Vina. The melodious flute-like symphony
  is then heard. It changes into a trumpet blast, vibrating like the dull
  rumbling of a thunder cloud. The seventh swallows all other sounds. They
  die and then are heard no more.” </p>
  <p>This project came into being in Fall 2024 as a side-effect of my
  deepening meditation practice and desire to hear the cosmic sound of
  Aum. I devised a plan for my thesis which would enable me to spend as
  much time as possible dedicated to training my mind in one-pointed
  concentration to achieve this goal. I committed myself to daily practice
  of the meditation techniques taught by Paramahansa Yogananda in the
  Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons, which have been an invaluable guide
  in this project and in this life. Other helpful guides have been found
  in Swami Sri Yukteswar’s The Holy Science and The Yoga Sutras of
  Patanjali. Interested readers will find great inspiration in Yogananda’s
  Autobiography of a Yogi.  </p>
  <p>Om Kriya Babaji Namaha!  </p>
  <p>This project and everything I do is dedicated to Babaji and the
  Gurus.  </p>
