    <p>Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the
        lake<br />
        and dress them in warm clothes again.<br />
        How it was late, and no one could sleep, the horses running<br />
        until they forget that they are horses.<br />
        It’s not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere,<br />
        it’s more like a song on a policeman’s radio,<br />
        how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days<br />
        were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple<br />
        to slice into pieces.<br />
        Look at the light through the windowpane. That means it’s noon, that
        means<br />
        we’re inconsolable.<br />
        Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.<br />
        These, our bodies, possessed by light.<br />
        Tell me we’ll never get used to it.</p>
        <p>“Scheherazade” by Richard Siken</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>My words are dissolving like an old, old man covered in mud hunched
        in the corner unexpectedly brooding - lazily, he fades into
        nothingness.</p>
        <p>In life, the semantics are drawn out, slowed to a tangible rhythm.
        Sentences pass by like a leaf in a stream, meanings are sucked out of
        damp stones, tongues course, jaws entangled - Inside in parallel, wet
        leaves flow through a winding mass I have only stepped in once. But as
        my mind clears and the clinging hand loosens its grip, leaf and river
        becomes scenery, and gently I reach into the stream and shape a human
        form from the mud.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Calmly following the relaxed ebb and flow of the waves expanding and
        contracting over mossy stones - gnarled pines stand proud and tall
        overhead, bathing me in their ancient wisdom - I am immortal.<br />
        Four figures twirling and dancing, the bass drum mimics the beat of the
        universe, guitars sing beautiful melodies, and contorted lips form a
        chorus that tugs at the heart - I am immortal.<br />
        Loving so deeply until you and the beloved become one, suffering so
        deeply until you and the suffering become one, it all coalesces into the
        infinite - I am immortal.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Trust the gut of the universe: It knows all because it has consumed
        all<br />
        Everything beyond the veil is also veil<br />
        Until you focus on the intuitive heart inside<br />
        And watch it get ripped apart<br />
        Just to lay open-<br />
        Trials by fire.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Ah.. so<br />
        So here we are:<br />
        Empty of our separation<br />
        All ears for the lover<br />
        Listening close to the pitter-patters of the intuitive heart<br />
        Swaying this way or that, gently tugging, an open brochure<br />
        Read the fine print closely<br />
        All the instructions are there:<br />
        How to find a home inside<br />
        How to hear what it is<br />
        This body must do<br />
        While I’m sitting here<br />
        Just sitting, so lovely<br />
        And watching the dance go on, the wheels turning<br />
        The old man’s hands withered and decaying<br />
        just as they should be.<br />
        Driving the car to go visit friends and also destroy innocent
        lives<br />
        in places that just so happen to be rich with oil<br />
        Man of oil-<br />
        He has many faces and limbs. And all of us,<br />
        Lost children<br />
        Running straight into his open, loving arms to horrible endings.<br />
        Every possible pain<br />
        every possible scrutinization<br />
        are all ours to share.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>And I’d go so far as to be<br />
        totally convinced that any<br />
        words I write down could<br />
        possibly explain how the<br />
        all-pervading light reflecting<br />
        across the lake and melting<br />
        into your face amidst total<br />
        darkness means anything<br />
        other than what it is-<br />
        And all the funny poems and metaphors<br />
        all mean the exact same thing<br />
        You know me and you know exactly<br />
        what I was thinking as the heavy<br />
        pounding rain folded up my green<br />
        pants and the celestial skies merged<br />
        into one great circle commanding<br />
        the rest of the night-<br />
        And sprinting<br />
        home you read my mind as my<br />
        senses all switched off<br />
        Sopping and dripping I<br />
        looked inside.</p>
        <p>And I’d go so far as to look at<br />
        the drawings on the wall and<br />
        be convinced that I drew them<br />
        wearing a face that vaguely resembles mine, then<br />
        Laying in the grass I would re-recognize<br />
        everything like how all of my friends are Gods.</p>
        <p>And given an opportunity to<br />
        learn from your heartbreak and tears<br />
        I know<br />
        We are open!</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Aimless, dreamlike.<br />
        Whether unnamed urban street<br />
        or endless fields<br />
        of glass, I keep on ending<br />
        up in the shadow of the<br />
        same view; glinting sun reflecting<br />
        on something tall and illusive like<br />
        a tree or tower or mound of dirt.<br />
        And craning my neck to get a glimpse<br />
        of the light, I stand on<br />
        tip toes unbalanced and unruly. It’s<br />
        the stretches of sand on the beach in November,<br />
        it’s burning the eyes on a stone<br />
        by the pond, it’s the blinding blue<br />
        vision that surrounds the<br />
        landscape up on the quarry behind<br />
        unfinished concrete caverns - when you realize<br />
        everything you know is dissolving. Ahhh… so…<br />
        it always circles back to that<br />
        moment of birth. That<br />
        moment that never leaves even<br />
        with three<br />
        deep<br />
        breaths.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>A knock on the door<br />
        Reverse engineering the hysteric dream<br />
        It’s constant mania<br />
        But through the plethora of swirling colors and motion<br />
        I burn my fingers in the flame</p>
        <p>I touch something Real in her hair</p>
        <p>The tension rising and falling and rising again</p>
        <p>We are all open here<br />
        No place for secrets or thoughts of my own</p>
        <p>It’s all shared journey<br />
        A place we’ve all been before<br />
        And here we are again<br />
        Walking ourselves back home</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>Butterfly kisses</em></p>
        <p>Take me to the place where we would plant butterfly<br />
        kisses on each other’s lips like the little kids we are,<br />
        Burning holes through our ocean skin,<br />
        Never quite understanding why we rejoiced when<br />
        the bright flame licked up any sense of meaning.<br />
        How our heavy feet made the world reverberate with<br />
        every slow step on unnamed streets-<br />
        And dissolve completely on sloping dunes.<br />
        And when we buried ourselves in sand from head to toe,<br />
        The waves,<br />
        With snow-white uniqueness, ever-changing-<br />
        But still waves all the same,<br />
        Would lull us gently to sleep.<br />
        Take me to the place where snakes writhe hidden,<br />
        Beneath our checkered protection-<br />
        On which we lie unaware,<br />
        Tugging on shining blades of grass.<br />
        Where our lazy fingers would draw random lines in the Earth.<br />
        And we would scream every obscenity that found<br />
        itself parasite to our bleeding tongues-<br />
        Never questioning this unobserved will,<br />
        Never wondering just how far down the water<br />
        reached under our outstretched, paddling arms.<br />
        Take me to the place where everything we touch<br />
        turns to flame-<br />
        And kiss me as we douse ourselves in gasoline.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>Doors wide open</em></p>
        <p>Constant non-attention<br />
        A plethora of ‘isms<br />
        Fragile ties to emphatic non-discretion.<br />
        See me<br />
        Lost in a sea<br />
        Or don’t see-<br />
        Textile granulations<br />
        As I touch on granite.<br />
        Leaves no marks but burns the hand,<br />
        untethered, but twisting<br />
        Wrings an owl’s neck<br />
        And suffers my addictions.<br />
        Fuel for the flame<br />
        Animalistic scavenging<br />
        Heavy, heavier<br />
        Let heave my holy lungs!<br />
        Imagine:<br />
        Indented in<br />
        Snowed in fields<br />
        Snuggled between gray cabins-<br />
        Once filled sections<br />
        Printed, patterned<br />
        Aloof and dragging<br />
        Like crust-filled crashing waves<br />
        Piano chords<br />
        And<br />
        Swaying in the wind,<br />
        Rebellious insufferable purpose<br />
        Doors wide open.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>Would you listen?</em></p>
        <p>The grey smoke upside-down drips thick<br />
        The surrounding air plays no tricks<br />
        In, my breath<br />
        -Out my exhale, the script<br />
        Pages I tore up and left<br />
        as litter on the street.</p>
        <p>If I don’t play for no-one<br />
        What is left on set?<br />
        Costumes, props, backdrops-<br />
        The actors all quit.</p>
        <p>If I’m a lonely observer,<br />
        One seat away, stage left,<br />
        I’m here to show the stage<br />
        I’m here to show myself.</p>
        <p>If I’m a lonely observer,<br />
        I make no effort-<br />
        I am no change.<br />
        But the play goes on,<br />
        And no one is there to hear it.</p>
        <p>If I’m a lonely observer<br />
        Consuming all sound,<br />
        filled with it, frothing at the edges<br />
        Would you listen?</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>Uh-tendencies</em></p>
        <p>What’s this discrepancy?<br />
        My tendency to my tendencies<br />
        A non-conversational complacency<br />
        Of informal formalcies</p>
        <p>What’s this discovery?<br />
        My sly shadow turns its back<br />
        Mirages I clench and expunge<br />
        Expanding secure un-securities</p>
        <p>What’s this redundancy?<br />
        I am a moon revolving habitually<br />
        Un-forming liquid light mercury<br />
        Shapes, faces, phases,<br />
        (Uncomfortable company)</p>
        <p>What’s my immunity?<br />
        Exposure of darkness, expulsion of light<br />
        Tear this bandage off the moon<br />
        Re-evolve me, resuscitate this orbit<br />
        (Left, right, up, out)</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>My ears are all plugged up<br />
        -Who are you talking to?<br />
        Look at me<br />
        Sway your hips<br />
        Milk a cow with your hands</p>
        <p>I have<br />
        No place to be<br />
        Or so I thought, watching your crescendo<br />
        Rise and rise and rise<br />
        Adversary to the sun<br />
        But-<br />
        You don’t come back down<br />
        You’re a song that never ends<br />
        A lava lamp set to boil</p>
        <p>Until,<br />
        It bursts into flame and pieces of goo<br />
        And terrific shining glass shards</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>Peelin’ it aside</em></p>
        <p>I used to think that darkness was<br />
        The natural state of things but now<br />
        My state of mind has changed and I<br />
        Am just where I was again but still<br />
        Somewhere completely different I think<br />
        Now that there’s a heavy wool blanket<br />
        Draped over things simulating obscurity<br />
        But if you happen to fall in love or<br />
        Get really high on stuff you can gain<br />
        The strength to timidly tug on just<br />
        A corner of fate-fulfilling warm<br />
        Illusion and peeling it aside you see<br />
        The bright mind-numbing Sun and it<br />
        Burns your face and eyes and dries<br />
        Your lips up like a fire and all you<br />
        Want to do is scream at the Sun for<br />
        Disrupting your pretty little nightmare<br />
        Place I think that anybody can really<br />
        Get used to anything even though<br />
        Change causes the worst of suffering<br />
        Is dissatisfaction just a part of me<br />
        Or will I ever be able to-<br />
        Look into the brightest lights without<br />
        Wincing and yearning for how things<br />
        Were before?</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>9:05 Katonah train</em></p>
        <p>How could I be anything<br />
        But totally and completely<br />
        relaxed-<br />
        As I gaze out the window<br />
        from my seat on the<br />
        train, and observe<br />
        the fleeting landscape<br />
        of graves?</p>
        <p>Across from me the seats<br />
        are empty and full at<br />
        the same time.</p>
        <p>When I close my eyes<br />
        and chant I am dead<br />
        and alive at the same time.</p>
        <p>Open them:<br />
        More graves, more peace.</p>
        <p>I’ve died so many times.<br />
        And lived to tell the tale.</p>
        <p>Ah!<br />
        A beautiful lazy river-<br />
        It’s corrupt.<br />
        By dirty concrete and<br />
        pollutants.</p>
        <p>Graves again<br />
        Oh!<br />
        A corrupt lazy river<br />
        interferes with concrete.<br />
        So:<br />
        I sit on my train seat<br />
        Uncorruptible.</p>
        <p>Do ya need an explanation?<br />
        If I give it to you it<br />
        won’t be explainable<br />
        Anymore.<br />
        The most I can say is<br />
        this:</p>
        <p>Rusty iron statue!<br />
        Flat, to an extent<br />
        Of mother and child<br />
        holding hands.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>I wasn’t ever able to get rid of that feeling of being left behind,
        so I just had to wait. But now that I’m finally here, it seems that
        everybody’s already gone. It’s a generous give and take, tugging on the
        pressure points in my ears. This must be what they meant by a beautiful
        refinement of the decline.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Breathe or get<br />
        High either<br />
        way I’m there<br />
        at that place<br />
        where it’s all<br />
        a beautiful screen<br />
        Reenacting<br />
        the full color and<br />
        character of the<br />
        lives of actors in<br />
        un-skippable advertisements<br />
        Who did you get this<br />
        time? Which set of<br />
        die did you roll?<br />
        I’m curious<br />
        as to how you<br />
        managed to pull<br />
        the cards this<br />
        type of way?</p>
        <p>Breathe out and<br />
        I’m sober.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>Universe</em></p>
        <p>Universe I know your face<br />
        universe you look just like me</p>
        <p>The aesthetic leaves me quite enamored<br />
        Who is this poetry-writer and do you do something like I do?<br />
        Do you see me like I see me through your eyes?<br />
        I only have a minute but I’m not a writer like that<br />
        I’ll go skinny dipping and lose my shirt and lose my wintered
        youth<br />
        I’ll wander and catch the wind with my arms if only I have the strength
        to lift them and grow feathers<br />
        And my heart will break so many more times<br />
        And maybe in a couple years I’ll recognize who exactly to blame for you
        going to prison.</p>
        <p>The exact words fade so quickly<br />
        How can I care?<br />
        When the significance is a shining something in the sand<br />
        Breathing in<br />
        Crashing, white existence<br />
        And breathing out<br />
        A happy return to nothingness.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>What is this overgrown pity party? A tangle of snappers, trippers,
        pointy bushes and roughened hands indefinitely loops in a mocking trail.
        It’s a bird with a huge beak and glowing, putrid eyes flocking in
        circles high above your head, shouting and cawing. Left wondering how
        such a large beak could ever be supported by wind and air, the cold
        handed slap reproaches.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Look,<br />
        This man sells his poems. They are original and on-demand for a few
        dollars. Here’s mine:<br />
        “Once again<br />
        Slipping into a<br />
        Translucent dream.”</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>More and more burning desire lines. Oh how fluid boundaries feel when
        you don’t believe they exist. I’m one here, twice nowhere. Nowhere but
        inside this calm relaxed center- Disinterested, totally involved.<br />
        Once again<br />
        Let’s begin:<br />
        Haven’t you heard?<br />
        The dogs are dead and there’s devils in the streets.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Disinterested, yet totally involved. The true mime portrays not just
        the glass box but all the empty space in between. The prison, in which
        is filled the very essence of freedom. Because the first step to
        understanding total unity with the universal consciousness is an
        acceptance of its passivity. Liberation is not an escape from the prison
        because that would entail a desire to not be in prison, which brings us
        right back to where we started, trapped in duality.<br />
        Letting go even of the desire to be enlightened…</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Tip toeing on the fragile line of infinity…<br />
        But what about all the other states of mind I’ve either never
        experienced or simply<br />
        forgot about? Racking my brains, I can only seem to come up with three
        boxes of<br />
        imagery all connecting to a certain drug or substance or activity. I
        wonder if<br />
        I can disconnect experience from its subsequent feeling. What is an
        autonomous<br />
        feeling? What is a raw experience, free from all forms of charisma and
        sharp edges?<br />
        There’s gotta be a) a lot more, b) nothin’ there at all, or c)
        something<br />
        incomprehensible.</p>

        <p>What have we got going on here? Experiential exposition… always a
        slow rise and a slower fall. Ah, here it is again!<br />
        The style changes every year.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Soaring through colorful skies<br />
        My melancholy grip on it all loosens with each subtle interference.</p>
        <p>Beautiful day! Not too fast, not too slow. My legs feel just
        right.<br />
        Beautiful day! Not too heavy and not too light. The air feels just
        right.<br />
        Yes I am light<br />
        Yes I am light</p>

        <p>Dear Diary,<br />
        A discussion has commenced. Recognition of un-reality and frugal
        inhibitions. A thunderclap summons two strangers, and the bat’s eye
        eclipses the night. Silently ignoring the Velvet Underground poster on
        the wall, my eyes lock onto the rain sneaking through the slits in the
        air conditioner. And my thoughts keep going back to two nights ago’s
        epiphanies. Two nights where you can’t tell which had a better full
        moon. And it really was a close call. The kind that might leave you
        feeling weak in the stomach… Drunk like the toddlers all lined up and
        clutching a rope with their tiny hands wearing bright yellow reflective
        jackets. Smiling and waving to random passerby and insects - give them
        little hard hats and they’ll be workin’ Men and Women on the site, the
        type of job that works up an appetite and tucks you into bed at
        night.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Hail who you think you are, fragile pretender<br />
        Hail to the guy in the funny suit,<br />
        And to the creeps, to the inviters,<br />
        To the teens and the shade —<br />
        Light rain now…<br />
        Hardly a smidge of reality to this air inside the air.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>It is all so seemingly unreal<br />
        Pull me back from this pathetic observer<br />
        Searching for meaning in the waves and crushing weight of my past
        actions.<br />
        Overwhelmed by the cacophony of my own creations-<br />
        Otherwise left to their own ramparts and delusion<br />
        This world is one of distorted bass and occasional screaming<br />
        And everytime I jolt myself from sleep to take just the smallest breath
        of fresh air-<br />
        That hint of a whisper in the wind,<br />
        “I’m home”<br />
        I’m home and it’s gone.<br />
        It fades into impossibility again.<br />
        There is no moderation in my faith<br />
        I am paddling in the ocean surrounded by hands reaching out to grab my
        wrists and pull me ashore but my eyes are shut tight and I don’t know
        hand from demon and my legs feel loose and the world is spinning-<br />
        I’ll go walking in the night.</p>
        <p>~</p>

        Down low<br />
        Too damn slow!<br />
        Bike man<br />
        Windows<br />
        Train man<br />
        Three boys<br />
        Hanging out in the pavement<br />
        Stretching.<br />
        Bridge-crossers<br />
        The bridge being crossed<br />
        And powerlines.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Walk in when you need us<br />
        Not a second before,<br />
        not a moment too late.<br />
        Relax:<br />
        You will always be on time!</p>

        <p><em>Suburban purpose</em></p>
        <p>Suburban purpose is<br />
        A tanker full of oil<br />
        Burning itself up as<br />
        it shoots past a<br />
        replica of itself going<br />
        in the opposite direction.</p>

        <p><em>Dead baby birds</em></p>
        <p>Clouds or waves or<br />
        Dead baby birds.<br />
        Have you ever seen a dead baby bird rotting beneath a dusty wood
        staircase?<br />
        The ants form very tight formations across its tiny limbs and bulging,
        deformed belly like a clove hitch tied over a horse’s face. Its mouth is
        wide open awaiting its mother to feed it. Never given the chance to lay
        hatchlings herself and feed them desperately, dead baby bird is still a
        mother of ants.<br />
        Mother of ant<br />
        Mother of an<br />
        Mother of a<br />
        Mother of<br />
        Mother<br />
        Mother<br />
        Mother of<br />
        All.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>The illusion has started to dissolve before my eyes. The system fails
        to reinvent the same scenes in a beautiful enough package - Total
        strangers fill and seep into pre-existing forms, and just now a
        butterfly landed safely on my finger tip while I turned my head from the
        helpless in total humility.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Basically:<br />
        Everything is clouds<br />
        They form<br />
        They dissipate<br />
        They form from what’s dissipated<br />
        We are clouds who<br />
        think we are clouds<br />
        Angry thunder<br />
        Sad rain<br />
        Calm air<br />
        Let go of form and become everything.<br />

        <p><em>Bird is so busy</em></p>
        <p>Bird is so busy only existing in such a state as devoid of
        unnecessary brilliance yet a total prerequisite like color in a 1,000
        piece puzzle to the non-compassing portrait of my vision.<br />
        The murky surface, unknowingly green, mirrors like a funhouse<br />
        Total fantasy.<br />
        Bird now disappearing, (the games never cease)<br />
        Other senses diminish the bounded eye.<br />
        And I can hear EDM reverberating a car maybe two blocks down.<br />
        Neon corner<br />
        Street corner pageantry<br />
        But still the green two-way is ever rising.<br />
        While neon corner<br />
        Or rather<br />
        Everything there ever was, is, or will be minus neon corner,<br />
        exudes light<br />
        Stolen for your sins from the constantly dwindling pre-conceived notion
        of what dusk should look like.</p>
        <p>Just check out<br />
        In deep solitude, one-sided voice of forgiveness pours deeply into
        itself with tremendous steel ladle<br />
        Upheaves the churning definer, soup of the pointer finger-<br />
        That I know anything at all!<br />
        Concepts morals morels and definition<br />
        fade dutifully into the places between non-being and being</p>
        <p>Well I get itchy just singing the songs of the birds and showing off
        my wings like they do.<br />
        I get silly, holding the door open for Mind At Large,<br />
        Seep through this hand of hands<br />
        And entice me with fragile grace.<br />

        <p><em>Crunch House</em></p>
        <p>Cheap beer and cigarettes<br />
        Funny guy’s too drunk laying in a tub and tearing at the wall’s
        insulation<br />
        Roll up with the dudes in the math-rock band<br />
        God I smell so bad<br />
        And this time Colin with one L lets you climb the ramparts and hang out
        dangling your feet above the crowd on the catwalk<br />
        And you can’t seem to catch anybody’s eye<br />
        Totally in love with red illumination<br />
        $20 3pm to 3am and thank God the beer’s free for bands<br />
        We will check IDs except we won’t<br />
        Everyone’s family here.</p>

        <p><em>LBI with Jake</em></p>
        <p>So structurally sound this plywood stands yet I curve with endless
        impunity. (Losing vision of the pencil in front of me) I leaf through
        all my outfits and pick something at random.<br />
        Now listening to “The Pull ’’ by The Microphones and sinking into the
        slow breath of unconsciousness, I consider the relative-ness of
        ephemeral contact.<br />
        “The Glow surrounds you<br />
        And when you breathed in I felt the Pull”</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>I think I’m starting to get it-<br />
        Baby holds baby and burps baby’s back<br />
        Keep baby in the shade because baby will get scorched by huge ball of
        fire in the sky.<br />
        Hardly a risk,<br />
        For the funny liquid Earth is so totally worth it<br />
        (to play in).</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Here I lay:<br />
        Journalist of my own desires-<br />
        Totally enraptured.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Living-knowing<br />
        Knowing without living<br />
        Knowing yet living noncommittally,<br />
        I play my games<br />
        I am a million shining-sea-silvers of slivered-star dust.</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p><em>Slip with dignity</em></p>
        <p>Currently I am hit by waves of nausea relating to the stretching of
        my fingernails and knuckles as I slip and scratch off the cliff of what
        my rational mind calls reality-</p>
        <p>Slowly<br />
        My breath reminds me<br />
        That the cold sea-water redefines<br />
        If only I jump in head first unhesitating!<br />
        And also<br />
        The fact that if I scramble my way up the rocky surface and stand
        courageously with my back straight and chin up<br />
        I will be shot<br />
        Proud soldier of the firing squad<br />
        And the sheer force will propel me backwards anyways.<br />
        So with deep breaths<br />
        Deep, slow<br />
        In, out<br />
        Totally aware yet completely relaxed<br />
        Slip with dignity!</p>
        <p>~</p>
        <p>Premonitions of instability<br />
        Reckoning with forces too obtuse to considered anything but
        neuroses<br />
        Or maybe I’m just being silly<br />
        For example, the fact that it’s taken two years for me to really
        understand that “two years ago” was a thing that actually
        happened.<br />
        So that’s done, but I’m still not sure who witnessed those events.<br />
        Why do I think I should be okay anyways?<br />
        I keep forgetting I am only two years old- and growing.</p>
