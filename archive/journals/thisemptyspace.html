            <p>If I’ve gone through Hell, it will always have been worth the trouble
            to once again feel the sun on my face. I glance up and see the rays
            colliding with leaves of a deep green, creating a golden hue of
            translucency. Penetrated with silence the golden leaves remind me that
            Heaven itself is right in front of me - and all of the confusion and
            suffering of the past and future simply melt away into an all-pervading
            present calmness. These golden leaves brimming with significance - I can
            touch the light with my eyes. And though I search for some balance, some
            unifying force between the peace and the fear, even the yearning for
            understanding dissipates. There are no words to describe what it means
            to rest, to calm, because words are defined by which ones come before
            and what letters come after. There is no defining the sunlight in the
            trees, the breath of release, the wind in my hair, the quiet of the
            pines, the contour of shadow, the texture of connection, the bliss of it
            all. So instead of trying desperately to define it, I’ll only glance up
            and feel the light. And if I’ve gone through Hell, it will always have
            been worth the trouble.</p>

            <p>“No man is an Iland, entire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the
            continent, a part of the maine; if a clod bee washed away by the Sea,
            Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a
            Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any man’s death diminishes
            me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know
            for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.” - John Donne</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>When walking, be sure to say, “With each step, I have arrived. With
            each step, I am home.” Understand that there is nowhere to go, no
            further progress to make and in fact there never was. There is only now,
            and it is perfection itself. When walking, be sure to take each step
            knowing this to be true and honing it in with stable mantra. Be on your
            guard - avoid taking steps with the momentum of previous ones,
            especially when going downhill; every individual step should be taken
            with dignity, precision, and awareness. Move forward while being able to
            stop completely at any given moment (without really having stopped - you
            are always at rest), and on stopping, be able to look around at your
            surroundings and say, “Oh, wow!” Awareness is pure, awareness is awe and
            wonder!</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>What does it mean to be human? I think a lot of it has to do with
            uncovering the secrets of the universe in an ecstatic moment of bliss,
            then letting it alone to chase a butterfly. Is it forgetfulness, some
            extremity of short-term memory? If so, I doubt we’d ever have the
            clarity required to piece ideas together into greater pictures. No, it
            must be purposeful. Intentionally, we loosen our grips on true meaning
            each time it presents itself subtly or screams its name in our ears. For
            fear? Indifference? Is it simply too much to bear, causing some sort of
            short-circuiting in the brain? I don’t know the reason, but this cycle
            is constant. Maybe it’s simply another consequence of living amidst
            duality. Circles and circles, stretching along an indifferent line,
            magnetized like the planets.</p>
            <p>“Truth waits for eyes unclouded by longing.”</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>I had a dream in a dream in a dream… In the deepest level, totally
            wrapped up in the scene (lacking awareness of personal identity), I
            roamed through forest and field, hopping trains and traversing
            mountains. Accompanied by indifferent, faceless travelers who glowed
            with an ethereal light, their hair floating impossibly, blueish green
            hues flecking off in rays, myself and two human companions fled through
            magical scenery. We were being chased by unnamed antagonists, and our
            winding journey attempted to throw them off our trail. Our faceless
            friends accompanied us without fear and without passion - they were not
            of this world. Eventually we reached the sea - beautifully unreal! The
            sky and water merged and had the same no-face god-like quality of our
            fellow travelers. There was a fence, and ducking under the loose wire,
            myself and my human friend forced ourselves through. I shouted back to
            the third, “Just duck and crawl, you’ll be okay!” but he ducked right
            where he was and tried crawling through a solid piece of fence where
            mine had had a hole. He got caught up and tangled and was approached by
            our enemy. Myself and the one who made it dived into the waters and swam
            and swam and swam and as we crashed against the white and pure waves our
            faces melted off and were replaced by the colors of heaven itself and
            our limbs were replaced with fins and we danced like dolphins in the
            waves ducking into total unbecoming immersion and flying back up into
            the air to take deep breaths of the cool white nothingness and in and
            out of the waves we lost ourselves and held onto nothing and embraced
            the indescribable purity of in and out and up and down and light and
            dark and it was all the same and nothing was unique and we were free,
            free, free.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Radiance light, breath of the universe. Delighting in the fog, I am
            empty and calm. Am I deluded? That’s just another thought to let go of.
            And I am empty again, calm - I trust the stillness.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>In-between world, where nothing ever happens, the “wood between the
            worlds,” the forest of stillness, dense fog settling - I hope it exists
            outside the forest. I would like to believe that concrete caverns, dark
            depths, and uncomfortable silences all contain this same nothingness,
            and that my heart deluded is all that causes an illusion of distinction.
            Maharaj-ji says, “It’s all One” and by now I know to trust his words. If
            it’s true then I have nothing to fear returning to shadowy hells - it’s
            all in-between anyway. Being doing, being doing nothing, nothing doing
            being, being nothing doing… all One. All One Is-ness. No artificial
            conglomerations. No demons in the dark. All one manifestation,
            beautifully real.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Coming and going nowhere else than where I am, I keep on defining
            this same place with words and metaphors - And I have been ever since I
            submerged myself in throbbing ocean life and let myself drown deep.
            Rising once more to sputter a few lines of poetry, I sink down into the
            dark greedily again. Reaching, grasping, peering around blind corners
            for what I know and have known is right before my eyes beckoning with
            open arms. Hello, my love, I’m right here. Beloved crawl into my open
            arms. Home, Om, one syllable, one word to replace my thousands,
            scrawling pencil-breath. One word is all I have been looking for. And
            found, one word is all I have been trying to write down. Enough, enough!
            Enough times have I misspelled “universe,” enough times have I sought
            when I have, eaten when I am full, smoked when I am high, yearned when I
            am. You know now, and you’ve known all along! Now these words are just a
            fun game. I can play forever and ever, or just let it end and gather up
            the pieces and say to my friends, “Oh, what a fun game we’ve had, shall
            we have another?” And we play until we run out of games and then we talk
            until we run out of words and finally we look into each other’s eyes and
            see the Light and hold the gaze until the fire burns us up inside and
            our eyeballs melt and droop liquid gold onto our laps but we can still
            see and we fold our hands and smile and enough of the games, enough of
            the words we only exist in a state that contains them all but is not
            held within them only always now only ever priceless void,
            possessionless, attributeless, personal unique empty beautiful void and
            we do not move our lips but the One word spills out over and over
            repeatedly One syllable “Om.” Om. Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om, Om
            infinitely… Infinitely we are One together and always have been, always
            having known and never to be forgotten again.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Know your thoughts to be a perfect stream with a source that draws
            all the way back to the ocean of beginningless creation and an end being
            cascading waterfall, crashing white. You sit by the side of the stream
            and delight in how the water shines, reflecting the sun’s rays into your
            eyes. You smile as the stream criss-crosses over rocks and in between
            stubborn plants, merging into them and creating a new unique shape. Oh,
            how lovely goes the stream of consciousness! Know you sit beside the
            stream calmly.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Yesterday I sat beside a busy intersection next to a little pond
            under a big sign that said in bold letters: </p>
            <p>“GO AHEAD, LET THEM JUDGE YOU”</p>
            <p>staring at the sun and I was very aware of my thoughts melting away
            and my mind clearing out and what remained was pure steady awareness and
            a lightness of being that permeated everything. It felt like the part of
            a dream that is no dream but is instead a glimpse into true reality.
            Later I thought to myself this moment was one of those moments that are
            so impossible to describe that they just slip from your memory. And
            until this moment returns, I lose sight of the fact that I have communed
            with God. Faith is, for now, trusting that these moments exist even if I
            forget forget forget. I forget, or maybe I never have had these moments
            because these moments include a complete breakdown of mental shackles
            and boundaries of personal identity, and therefore “I” am not involved.
            And when these moments happen in the presence of others I forget that
            they are experiencing the exact same thing because I think of how it is
            for “I” to be experiencing such a thing forgoing the whole experience of
            non-duality because if my awareness is your awareness and my awareness
            loses identification with “I”, then “my” experience and “yours” are the
            same, which, if my ego gets involved, feels more isolating than ever,
            being the only Being in existence forever always and endlessly but I
            forget that this moment is the antithesis of loneliness and here we all
            are One One One is not two and if One is One then One is Zero and I am
            not here I am empty and we are finally together in love.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>There’s something so peculiar about it - Something so glistening
            bright, idea stretching greater than life itself endlessly expanding -
            fascination subdued, totally in control of the ferocity, it has you in
            its wraps, ready to lift you up and carry you gracefully across cloudy
            skies and every once in a while you get a peek beneath at the sprawling
            cities and lights and flashing lives and for a moment you yearn for it,
            recognition, recognizable ritual, references that make sense and roll
            off the tongue like a golden honey, the kind that gets you drunk in the
            jungle leaves but soon doubts re-cover up the feeling of home and here
            you are flying in beautiful skies and you’re on the train again going
            back to the city and ahead is unknown, ahead is future and novelty and
            honestly everything you’ve ever strived for and it’s so horribly
            beautiful so unleashed and glorious and you’re so alone somehow, somehow
            even in this rush of independency. Floating free, free-falling faster,
            faster, downwards plummet pushed off the tripwire that was your previous
            definition of everything that was and would be of any importance. And
            falling free the wind in your face forces open a smile and it’s wide and
            toothy and a scream ruptures through your lungs and says “I’m home, I’m
            home, I’m home.” But you’re just 19 and how serious could it be anyway?
            Not very.</p>

            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>When I read a book the words say “Ram.” When I write a poem the words
            are “Ram.” When I open my mouth to speak I say only “Ram.”  When I
            listen to the wind in the trees it says “Ram.” When I feel the sun on my
            face I say “Ram.” When someone is scared or confused I hear them saying
            “Ram.” What does it matter how I react, if I am secure, If I get what I
            want, if I don’t, it’s all “Ram.” Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram.
            Shall I have a cup of tea? Ram. Shall I read a book? Shall I write a
            song? Shall I play guitar? Ram Ram Ram. Shall I sit and chant “Ram”? Ram
            Ram Ram. Shall I suffer, shall I cry alone? Ram. Shall I hang out with
            my friends, my family, my lovers, my enemies, my foes, my teachers, my
            siblings, my imagination, myself? Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Marty, Seb, Phoenix, Matteo, Henry, Koala, CJ, James, Joe, Calvin,
            Darren, Don, Sparky, Sly Dave, Fisherman, Matt, all of us. We had no
            bodies then.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>This is what unbearable suffering is - it’s a translation device. It
            burns us away into white spotless ash and exchanging remains we connect
            in ways that go beyond this fleeting moment in time. I see your bones
            beneath burnt flesh… they look just like mine.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>We literally had no bodies for a moment. We floated through sidewalks
            greenways and parks, passing and becoming, trading the mouthpiece and
            holding gently to the strings. Exchanging positions, meandering thoughts
            and speech, old friends and new it didn’t matter - we literally had no
            bodies then.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>I have no questions. I want nothing. What is there to desire? I’m
            filled with joy just with a breath. I find it hard to be in an intimate
            relationship with someone because I am falling deeply in love with
            everyone I meet. The space between us is lessening, there are less gaps
            inhibiting our embrace. I think I’ll be comfortable anywhere. In any
            situation, any life, any plan, any symbol, any reality. I want to live
            straight so I can remember who I am at all moments and merge into them
            blissfully and without fear. It’s getting there, it really is. What
            could I want? What more could I want? Maharaj-ji would ask for an apple
            at most.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>There’s that coolness in the air again, that faint smell of the fall.
            Autumn is coming, and I already know it’s going to tear me apart. My
            heart will break again and again and again. Ram Dass said, “See what’s
            left…” </p>
            <p>See what’s left. This empty space, this hollow dream… let it not be
            enclosed.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>I literally think about nothing else. </p>
            <p>Purify, and wait for grace.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Awareness is the sky. And here I am again, thinking I am a cloud!
            Passions, ideas, plans, opinions - all passing phenomena. What do I
            want? What do I need? What am I here for? - Passing identifications of
            my reality, different motivations altering perception. I want, I should,
            I ought, and there it goes. Watch it come, watch them go. Awareness is
            the sky. And of course it all becomes dull in this zooming out of who I
            think I am, of course nothing can satisfy. All desires and their
            attainment are more clouds passing by the all-encompassing portrait of
            my pure vision. I am the sky! I am the sky! Do your best to remember and
            stay in union with it all. Chant mantra all you want, useless words if
            I’m not grasping their intention. The intention is this: Remember who
            you really are. And all else falls away…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Once again caught up in what I know is only relatively real - so
            sure! So sure of myself! I think - I’ll drop out, I’ll live in a van,
            I’ll travel the world and free my mind. Hello, thought, hello, passing
            cloud. I am the sky and I will not cling to this enticing offer. Mouth
            watering statement of my own free will… Delicious! How delightful! To
            pursue a plan, and envision a world as I’d like it to be! Let go, let
            go. Here I am, watching this thought and I remember. Cluttered
            phenomena… grip me no longer! I am a master of my own fate. True freedom
            is staring into the void and entering into it as a candle in evening. I
            have plans… I have places to be… foolish caress! Sneaky ego, conniving
            villain! I know who I am, and I am not you, only partially, I am not
            empty, only partially, I am __________! Good one! You thought you could
            catch me this time, in my own head no less! I recognize you, my guru in
            drag, manifesting in my own mind! I choose, here, I choose to let go of
            thought forms, plans and ideas, and enter into void. Here is a path
            myself (as somebody, playing) has laid out. Here is a path myself (as
            somebody, playing) observes myself (as somebody) following. Can nobody
            change this course? Somebody can, oh certainly, but who is that anyway?
            I don’t see you, I look away, no, I accept you into me with humility
            knowing myself to be much more. I will act, I will make my play, by
            doing nothing, for nobody has nothing to do! Now I’m confusing myself
            again… in summation:</p>
            <p>Oooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmm…. on infinitely…</p>
            <p>Forcefully here and indisputably real, the swaying in the trees
            reminds me of what I once knew to be absolute truth, now is only
            memory.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram Ram…</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>And how we would dance! When the guitar strings sound like the fields
            of hay stretching out forever. And the golden green tint of the sun
            merging with leaves on an old, familiar tree. Essence blooming, just
            pouring itself out of its body. </p>
            <p>Energy is shooting out of my hands!</p>
            <p>Delicious textures… mmm, what a nice thought, what a lovely cloud.
            Even this tree is passing phenomena, even this moment and this memory
            and those feelings that just felt so damn real, so pressing, so big!
            Even those, even those. Just moments. Just another moment. The wind on
            my face… don’t bother trying to define it. Just feel the wind in your
            face. Let it be just what it is. And the leaves are just leaves and they
            are perfect.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>A quick recap: </p>
            <p>I am a being with certain psychological, physical, and astrological
            “things” to work out by making use of my incarnation in the physical
            realm. I am in a body to do this work in order to “awaken.” I’m not too
            concerned if or when I do and am in no rush because time is only
            relative to the physical plane and when I’ve moved on from it or
            integrated it into the whole totality of my being time will not exist
            and I will have always been eternal (this is true now). I have a certain
            set of karma to work out that is being worked out by my psycho-social
            environment, ideas, thoughts, and motives. Zooming out far enough, I see
            that all karma, this web, is a series of lawful events unfolding
            according to the nature of our bodies and minds. Because of this I have
            free will to work on myself but simultaneously have no choice at all -
            this process of awakening has been going on for many cycles. I do not
            remember my past incarnations but can get in touch with the essence of
            my being by aligning my life with my astrological role, which I also
            have no memory or control over. Things feel correct when my physical
            experience is on course with my astrological identity, but, be warned,
            do not get caught up in this feeling and continue working. Getting
            caught up in the unity/harmony/Oneness of it all while disregarding the
            separateness (my physical identity) is just as disarming as the
            opposite. Knowing myself to be not the actor in my life (but also the
            actor), and not to expect any reward (karma works in ways far beyond by
            physical understanding), do your work and let go. The universe is a
            dance, a game, a play, a giggle. Will you participate in it from a place
            of… gah! Or a place of… ahhh… </p>
            <p>Enter into the flow state offered to you by your passions and
            activities you love but do not be caught up in them as totally real.
            Everything I can experience is only partially real. A flashlight cannot
            point onto itself! Remember, I cannot know myself because I am myself!
            The way to knowing myself is through service to people and to the world.
            Do everything with the light of intention and consciousness - aware of
            the fact that I am in constant interaction with the divine. And please,
            don’t take things so seriously! When you fall off the path, when you
            make mistakes, when you feel wrong… this is it! This is the path! </p>
            <p>“Life is carving scripture into your flesh…”</p>
            <p>There are no mistakes in the game. Learn to accept your failures as
            lessons, important ones. Meditation is not perfectly following your
            breath without fail, it is noticing that you’ve stopped doing so. Pick
            yourself up and get back to it. You will fall thousands of times and
            pick yourself up thousands more. Don’t kid yourself either, don’t go
            pretending it’s all perfect when you’re scared. Accept both. Accept
            fully your emotions but remember the giggle. Two things can happen
            simultaneously and we can function on multiple planes of reality at any
            one given moment. </p>
            <p>Maharaj-ji says it’s all One. Yes, that is true! But we are also
            separate. Honor both, honor it all, love it all. There is a reason for
            everything.</p>
