When I got to college I saw a flyer for a NYC band called Girls Can't Skate looking for a drummer.
 I ran to the studio every day and learned how to play drums so I could join the band.
 I sent a vid of me playing "Bet my Blood" by Pretty Sick as an audition. Eventually I 
 had to leave the band to become a yoga teacher, but the short time I spent with Dev, Dot, and Em will remain with me forever
  as a joyous, heart-felt experience.<br><br>
