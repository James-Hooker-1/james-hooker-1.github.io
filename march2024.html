</header>
<p>March 2024</p>
<p><strong>Leaving footprints in the snow</strong><br> <strong>Where only
birds and deer step</strong> <br><strong>I am part of this world</strong>
<strong><br>This place of no place</strong> <strong><br>Where uniqueness
converges into pure essence of being</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been given the tools to clear the <br>land and dig myself deep into
the Earth-<br> and the patience to watch my roots grow<br>strong and weathered<br>
But everytime I lie down in the soil it’s<br> like trying to go to sleep
with my feet<br> sticking out from under the blankets <br>shoveling the dirt
over my head feels wonderful <br>until I start itching and sprouting and<br>
some vital part of me shoots out like<br> a zombie’s hand and pulls me from
the grave<br> It seems<br> I am helplessly addicted to self-uprooting.<br> Planting
a seed and ripping it out of the<br> Earth a day or two later<br> like a little
kid’s science experiment- <br>Teacher says give it time <br>And little kid pouts
but listens</p>
<p>I pout but drop out of college<br> and tell everyone in town that I’ve
found<br> a magic bean stalk which will carry us all up to heaven.<br>
Occasionally, I say this with conviction.<br> And by the way,<br> You can tell I
am lying by the smoke that<br> escapes a clenched grin-<br> and in my nihilist
fingers,<br> The loose swagger of self-deprecation<br> stubbing it out in
disgust.</p>
<p>Overconfidence is a signal of my emaciated ego<br> And nothing hurts
better than burn-out.</p>
<p>That’s why I make my bed in the morning<br> and change into warm clothes
at night<br> and pray I wake up somehow different.<br> That’s why, when I gaze
up at the priest<br> from underneath the floorboards I forget<br> which one of
us is on acid. Because,</p>
<p>Self-uprooting is a double-blind study between<br> myself now and myself
three seconds ago-<br> and I know a journalist in Boston who says<br> the
commitment will pay for our indulgences<br> down the line.</p>
<p>​​<strong>But I was light, I was arrogance. I read On the Road on the
subway itching to smoke something as soon as I tasted air again. Pour
the stars on my shirt like burnt coffee - that’s what this subway is
like. Eye contact, what a bitter line of poetry! The moment trickles
down my back. I remember lights in the sky. Would it always be
off</strong>  <strong><br>at 33rd street?</strong></p>
<p>I dropped off a note for the cellist in the marble dungeon of Grand
Central Station. It said: “You got <em>IT</em>!” because it felt like he
had it - at least for a moment. It was more obvious in the faces of the
crowd, who were almost drooling in their captivation - the cellist,
however, noticed me scrawling on the scrap of paper, debating how best
to gently express what I really felt like doing - whooping and hollering
O Hallelujah sweet lord and shouting this is <em>IT</em>! This is
<em>IT</em>! Can’t you see him go? Heartbroken, absorbed, all of it came
across his sullen bow, his mourning fingers. I decided on what to
say</p>
<pre><code>(knowing, of course, that it could never convey anything. Talking about it is like dancing about architecture, if you know what I mean). I dropped the folded note into the open cello case like a bandit. It fell alongside a few scattered dollars and a printout of a QR code - it landed gracefully.   So I </code></pre>
<p>turned and skipped away like<br> a deer on the roadside to track<br> 18, back
North again, back to my own<br> drunken captivation…</p>
