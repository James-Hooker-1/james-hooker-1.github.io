<p><em>Please submit a brief essay explaining (1) your interest in and
concern for civil liberties; (2) the sources of your commitment to
protecting and preserving civil liberties and human rights; and (3) your
future plans for acting on these commitments.</em></p>
<p>Fighting for the preservation of civil liberties and human rights
within an institutional setting is not always the most flattering story.
In the prime of their disobedience, civil rights movements are often
demonized, touted as violent mobs, and defamed in countless ways. But
after the pressure reaches a breaking point and real popular change is
implemented, history forgets the friction. Ask any public school: It’s
easier to talk about MLK Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” than the brutal
assassinations of Fred Hampton and Malcolm X. It’s easier to celebrate
how far we’ve come, and forget the lynchings, the hate, and the
bloodshed. We just don’t want to look at it - ourselves, really - in
that terrifying light. </p>
<p>I want to look into that light because I don’t want to be afraid of
anything. That’s all.</p>
<p>So I looked - and it became the <em>glow of the moon on a cool April
night, just as bright as the fluorescent bulbs dotting the perimeter of
the field. I watched that moon creep across the would-be starry sky -
would-be if it wasn’t busy absorbing an oceanic pulse from the city that
never sleeps. Some might have slept, in shifts, but most stayed up
chain-smoking cigarettes or looking for cigarettes or talking about
their families. It was a quiet night, a long night, one that served as a
gentle release from the hours of chanting, marching, mass-arrests, fear
and overcoming fear, the exhaustion of the crowd, losing yourself in it.
The constant surveilling of the sky for drones and low-flying
helicopters and watching the streets for police buses transitioned into
a somehow relaxing, whispered,</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey, cover your face. Zionists.”</em></p>
<p><em>But they were just stalkers with phones and not armed NYPD
special units in riot gear. I thought of the Russian girl, Varia - I met
her in the cold night as we marched outside campus with the protesters
chanting, “Intifada, Intifada, long live the Intifada!” …We met eyes and
matched footsteps.</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t know if I can chant. I came here on asylum…”</em></p>
<p><em>She told me how she was arrested in Russia, how she saw the
anti-war resistance gain confidence only to be crushed by
gunfire.</em> </p>
<p><em>“Jail was fine for me. I wasn’t beaten… In Belarus they organized
- fine, until they started shooting into the crowd.”</em></p>
<p><em>Over 100 student protesters were arrested violently by the NYPD -
the first time non-campus police were allowed inside Columbia University
in 60 years.</em></p>
<p><em>“They start with this, then it’s beating, and then it’s
Russia.”</em></p>
<p><em>For a while we walked in silence, until we saw a kid slip in
between the bars of the campus gates.</em> </p>
<p><em>“Shall we?” I felt suave.</em></p>
<p><em>“Let’s do it.” She winked. Maybe she did too.</em></p>
<p><em>We squeezed in, handing each other our bags through the bars,
keeping an eye out for cops like criminals, which we were. Inside we
joined the encampment, grabbed some coffee. I gave her my scarf, my hat,
my gloves when it got cold.</em> </p>
<p><em>“I quit three months ago, but if there was ever a moment for a
cigarette…”</em></p>
<p><em>She left, and watching the moon I passed the night in silence. As
the sun crept up so did another low-flying helicopter, marking the 3rd
day of the encampment. Cops set up barricades around the lawn while kids
played soccer and danced, I did some yoga, we stretched our achey bones
and waited in long lines for the restroom. If anything else, the tents,
blankets, tarps, and bodies sprawled on the grass remain in joyful
dignity…</em> until they were torn down again, with more arrests, more
students beaten. </p>
<p>That was the night of April 18th, 2024, nearly a year ago now. I can
still feel the florescent bulbs on my closed eyelids, the sound of the
helicopters, the smell of cigarette smoke and the confused, ecstatic
solidarity. Though I write romantically no romantic idealism obscured
the political potential of this decade’s student uprising. It was all
rough, it was all crisis, quintessentially serious. No love freaks here,
no mantras or mala or rock bands or a return to innocence; that’s all
been done before. We cashed in the dead-end love-trip for cold, hard
reality.</p>
<p>Example: My band held a fundraiser show to help a friend’s extended
family pay for an evacuation from Gaza. We set up at a park in Hoboken
and jammed until the cops shut it down. We raised over $500, and a few
days later the exorbitant payments (almost $6,000 each) were made, and
my friend’s pregnant sister and her husband safely crossed into Egypt. A
few months later, the baby boy was born. On that same day, three more of
her family members who didn’t make it to Egypt were murdered by an
Israeli strike in Rafah. </p>
<p>I wonder if that ever happened to the Dead.</p>
<p>Looking into the bright light burns your eyes. How do you handle it?
For the new student movement, it was heavy consequentialism. “Turn on,
tune in, drop out” became “turn off, shut down, and keep moving.” At
first we took turns covering our eyes and hiding under the covers,
watching in anticipation as one brave soul at a time ventured out of the
comfort zone. They came back with the latest news. </p>
<p>“118 killed collecting flour. Your turn.”</p>
<p>The brave ones collapsed in well-earned ignorance. We covered their
shaking bodies with mental health checks and shared trauma. Soon another
went to keep watch, and this absurd game of duck-duck goose continued.
See, activism isn’t like a hobby that can be experimented with according
to convenience and availability. It’s like consciously working through a
nightmare that never ends. And when it’s your turn to step outside,
there’s no choice but to see it through. </p>
<p>Paradoxically, the more involved you get, the more you’re sucked in;
the more you want to give everything. I think of Rachel Corrie, an
American activist who was crushed to death by an Israeli bulldozer while
defending a Palestinian home in Rafah. She was 23. In her letters to
home, Rachel Corrie wrote, “I think it is a good idea for us all to drop
everything and devote our lives to making this stop… I still really want
to dance around to Pat Benatar and have boyfriends and make comics for
my coworkers. But I also want this to stop.” I hear Rachel Corrie’s
words when I go to class, and play guitar, and do all the normal things
I do. I want to do all those normal things, I want to sing and dance and
be free. But I’ve also seen my friends bodied by cops and bitten by
their dogs, doxxed online, face death threats and racial slurs all for
speaking up against an ongoing genocide. The question of <em>if</em>
quickly becomes irrelevant. The answer of <em>how</em> most likely lies
in deep introspection on a personal level. But there’s no time for
introspection; we only had the cards we were dealt, and we went all in.
We gambled our hearts. </p>
<p>I started by converting the connections I had made playing music into
activist groups. I reinstated Stevens Amnesty International, which is
currently doing great work with the “Dismantle the Mass Deportation
Machine” initiative. A group of friends and I created Stevens Students
for Justice in Palestine, which quickly grew to include over 200 general
board members. We organized Stevens’ first on-campus demonstration since
the 2019 Gianforte Family Hall protest, and invited speakers from
renowned organizations such as Ceasefire Now and Jewish Voice for Peace.
The event gathered over 120 students, faculty, and staff members. We
created the Stevens Divest from War Initiative, and met with Stevens’
CFO to discuss avenues towards ethical investing. We drafted a 30-page
divestment proposal including sections on university values, campus and
community interest, and an approach to divestment within Stevens’
existing endowment management structure. We presented the proposal to
the Senate of the Student Government Association with the support of 497
undergraduate students, 67 signatures from local community members, 68
alumni, and 14 faculty members, as well as the endorsements of 21
Stevens student organizations. Over a year’s worth of financial
research, diligent editing, and community building culminated in two
nights of nearly seven hours of discussion. A few members of the public
called us hate preachers, anti-semitic, and seeking to cause division on
campus - which we countered by inviting all of the “opposition” to voice
their concerns in the editing phase of the second draft. Nobody showed.
At the conclusion of the second meeting, the initiative failed to pass
the 2/3 Senate majority by 2 votes. Love, it seems, did not win in the
end this time; we hit a dead-end.</p>
<p>Now in the interim, there is time for constructive reflection. But
instead, self-doubt rushes in; consequentialism meets its match. Did we
<em>fail?</em> Was it any one individual’s fault? Could it be the mass
colonial-karma of our society to be absolutely helpless while others are
massacred in our name? To have no outlet for the guilt and no escape
from complicity? To be gaslit for speaking out, to be called a terrorist
while advocating for peace? On the surface, we seem to have accomplished
nothing in terms of social and political change. Anti-Palestinian racism
is just as prevalent now as it’s ever been. And every day I still open
my phone to news of increasing death tolls and live images of shredded
children. Those murdered children, immortalized in my mind forever by
Hind Rajab’s tiny cries… our collective voice voted against their
survival. </p>
<p>If nothing else, I think it was worth it to look into the bright
light. That cold, harsh reality. That twilight zone of human suffering
where the air is still and the mist hangs heavy on the earth. There’s no
sound or gravity in that place. It’s a hunter’s anticipation. It makes
you bare your teeth and howl at the moon. It’s animalistic. It’s real
life. In the midst of social upheaval the diffused light of heaven and
earth are interpreted as one mystery. Is the sun just below the horizon
or is it rising for a new day? I wish this wasn’t the end of my thought
process on the matter. I wish I had a happier conclusion to share. Truth
is, I don’t. So for now, here’s to activism, and all my future
plans: </p>
<p>Godspeed to another dead-end. And hoping history forgets the
friction.</p>
