<p>Some things I noticed include a hesitancy to write in pen - not for
the permanence of it but because it bleeds through to the back of the
page; my soft bated breath heroically resisting the howling winds at the
lookout on Skyline Drive - not knowing enough to declare independence
from my habits but meaning to every time cigarette smoke dries up my
throat so I can’t breathe right the rest of the day - instead choosing
to smoke only at night for the quick amnesia; I’m forgiven and gratified
come morning - and my lungs are a yellow-stained hallway in the lobby of
a motel somewhere far away where I throw open the windows and my bags on
the bed and open my arms wide and shout Home, Sweet Home! for all the
parking lot to hear it. </p>
<p>I noticed inspiration spikes and pitfalls and spikes <em>in</em>
pitfalls. Should I leap right over or in or gently lower myself down?
Playing the tape in my car (it was a perfect record of Richmond and DC,
the nights with Ted and Grace, Jake, Anna, Jay but I only learned their
names saying heart-felt goodbyes on the patio in a light rain) so I must
have made a choice one way or another. Ted invited me to Spain. We
talked about dreams and adventures and couldn’t admit we were in one.
You just can’t admit <em>that</em>. </p>
<p>I made plans by doing nothing. Watch it fall into place and give up
entirely. I noticed how beautiful the whole thing is and fell in love
with everyone again, if it wasn’t obvious.</p>
<p>Did you know Jim, the guy selling Möney’s merch is friends with
Fontanez, and Salt too? He was an old Yarga-head, of course, just like
Fontanez was young in Hartford and I might be young too but it sure
doesn’t feel like it. I feel like a piece of tape holding up a
hand-drawn show flyer by the mantle in VSC from 2014. I can feel a
blurry face see me wilting and reach up to rub me real hard back into
place. Back straight and really stickin’ now, unnamed heads outside to
rejoin the decades old mingle of leather jackets, pins and punk
memorabilia. I might switch places with a piece of brown glass poking
out from under the stairs, or maybe one of the hundreds of cigarette
butts in the concrete receptacle; flipped on its side and expanded it
becomes a hollow, pitch-black cylinder stretching two miles to the other
side of the mountain. Just a couple yards in Paw Paw tunnel I could only
see my feet in a little puddle, and the infrequent but comforting drip
of runoff tracing the hard, loose shale to rejoin the Chesapeake &amp;
Ohio Canal. The stream is nearly still, silent, and out of sight. I took
a few more steps then ran back to the door-shaped light - deep breath of
relief in the open sky, I crushed my can and headed back to the
campsite.</p>
<p>Later, half-asleep in my car I learned to tell the time by the angle
of moonlight on the little pond at Greg’s farm, Shenandoah,
Virginia: </p>
<p>there was a tornado warning in the valley that night and Greg said,
“Keep an eye to the sky, not much of a shelter in my barn but you ought
to be okay. Mountains protect us here pretty good,” which they did. They
protected, served, and inspired. They created that funnel of wind I was
talking about, that harsh whip in my face leaning over the edge. They
created a boulder-cradle which rocked me to sleep like a parent loves a
baby; </p>
<p>I was all three. Now adolescent eating cherry pie in Rudy’s Diner we
asked the waitress what’s happening in town. She said, “In Shenandoah,
don’t blink and you’ll miss everything.” </p>
<p>We blinked and missed it all anyway as the scenery shifted to Lina’s
place, a cozy little farm where a great white Pyrenees bear-dog named
Aspen led us to a soft patch of grass to rest our heads that night. We
set up camp, Aspen tagging along, maintaining that calm, graceful air of
an experienced farm dog. Grateful for the company, we pet and played
with and tackled that dog till the sun stooped below the mountains and
we sped off to Charlottesville again. It was “Curtis on Tour” at UVA’s
Old Cabell Hall - a round chamber with wide, open ceilings and a golden
organ adorning the walls - with the legendary Jason Vieaux on guitar and
Robert Díaz on viola, alongside two unnamed women in matching red dress
to round out the quartet. A replica of Raphael’s “School of Athens”
dominated the theater’s back wall. Zach pointed out Pythagoras and
Socrates. I counted 17 slack-jawed sleepers in the crowd of old and
balding dignitaries getting their hit for the evening during the second
movement of Paganini’s “Quartet in A minor.” Before the piece Díaz
explained everything &amp; I have to be honest, it ruined my night. See
my double-standards? A writer is a con-man, don’t forget it.</p>
<p>Hesitancy put aside, it was time to get active. “Let’s go ride the
mini truck,” Jack said with certainty. If there’s one person in the
world I can trust with my life to rip through Washington’s every stop
sign while I’m bouncing around in the pickup - it’s Jack. And he floored
it, I mean really pushed that tiny truck through the winding black
streets and the empty ownerless fields and the empty manicured fields
behind lit-up empty mansions - and away from all that, once more in the
dark tunnel of night and into the star-shaped passageway, </p>
<p>right through to eternity.</p>
